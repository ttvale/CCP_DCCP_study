NetduinoMQTT

Introduction:

This is a simple, QoS 0, MQTT (MQTT.org) client.  

It can be used by the Netduino to send MQTT messages to a MQTT broker and subscribe to topics.

This program is intended to be VERY readable - even at the expense of size/performance.

The program.cs is just an example of using the library functions to interact with a broker.

Version 0.02 supports:
1.  Everything from 0.01(a)
2.  Subscribing and unsubscribing
3.  The client will respond to broker pings
4.  The sizes of the various fields have been arbitrarily shortened
    to keep this from eating all of the memory.

Version 0.01(a) supports:
1.  Connecting to an MQTT broker (RSMB and mosquitto have been tested) (Section 3.1)
2.  Sending MQTT messages to a broker (Section 3.3)
3.  Disconnecting from a broker (Section 3.14) 
4.  Pings (used for keep alive - example in program.cs)

Version 0.01 will not be further enhanced (beyond bug fixes and maintaining protocol support at this basic level of functionality).  I think it is important to keep a publish only version without the QoS or Subscribe stuff.  I think this is important both for understanding the basics and for a very small client.

I'm not sure where version 0.03 is going.  Maybe QoS 1 and basic broker functionality.  Maybe just QoS 1.  Maybe add in MQTT-S forwarder or  gateway functionality.

None of this has been comprehensively tested.  If you do any testing - please let me know your results.  I did some very basic functional testing that seemed good and I'm planning on testing further when time allows.  But, if you use this - I'd love the feedback/assistance.

Thanks
