This hudson plugin allows you to read a jumble xml report and generate a report on a build basis along with a trend graph for the overall project score.
It will let you set the target project score so you can check if you are meeting the goal.
See the downloads section for the JumbleHudsonPlugin.hpi to install it in your hudson.
