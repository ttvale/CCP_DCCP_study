= What is this good for =

As discussed on [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7905501/get-rid-of-pom-not-found-warning-for-org-eclipse-m2elifecycle-mapping/|stackoverflow]]
the {{{lifecycle-mapping}}} plugin is just a placeholder for the configuration of Eclipse.
However right now, as the plugin does not exist at repo1.maven.org, maven spits out the following:

{{{
[WARNING] The POM for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0 is missing, no dependency information available
[WARNING] Failed to retrieve plugin descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0: Plugin org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0
}}}

which is confusing. When you run a CI server, people will come and ask what these warnings mean.
So I created a dummy nonsense plugin, just to provide a valid plugin which will 
do nothing.

= How to install =

The easiest way is to checkout the repository and run {{{mvn install}}} or 
{{{mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository=REPOID::default::PLUGIN_REPO_URL}}}.

Otherwise you may download the 
[[https://raw.github.com/mfriedenhagen/dummy-lifecycle-mapping-plugin/master/pom.xml|pom]] 
and the 
[[https://github.com/downloads/mfriedenhagen/dummy-lifecycle-mapping-plugin/lifecycle-mapping-1.0.0.jar|binary jar]]
and run:
* {{{mvn install:install-file -DpomFile=pom.xml -Dfile=lifecycle-mapping-1.0.0.jar}}} or
* {{{mvn deploy:deploy-file -DpomFile=pom.xml -Dfile=lifecycle-mapping-1.0.0.jar -DrepositoryId=REPO_ID -Durl=PLUGIN_REPO}}}
