Commons-gdx
=============

Provides a lot of common utilities to work with the following projects:

* [libGDX](http://code.google.com/p/libgdx) - The libgdx project is a cross-platform game development library written in Java with some JNI code for performance hungry sections. It abstracts away the differences between writing desktop and Android games based on OpenGL. Applications can be prototyped and developed entirely on the desktop, then only 6 lines of code are needed to run your app on Android. Develop more efficiently using powerful desktop tools such as HotSwap, without needing to wait for your application to be deployed to a device each time it is run. 
* [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/) - An Entity system framework based on components.
* [animation4j](https://github.com/gemserk/animation4j) - A project to animate stuff by using interpolations between keyframes.
* [jresourcesmanager](https://github.com/gemserk/jresourcesmanager) - A project which abstracts resource/asset interaction and management.

This is a personal project we are using to create our games at [Gemserk](http://blog.gemserk.com/), code could be unstable so if you want to use it, do it with caution. 

If you want to see some examples you can take a look at our games at Github.
