This is my first project.

What this code is all about?
. One can render a pdf. 
. One can swipe left or right to change pages.
. One can also click on the buttons to change the pages.
. One can zoom or pan.

What it doesn't do?
. One cannot use the swipe gesture to change pages once the page is zoomed.
. One cannot load a pdf file dynamically, it has to be in the resources.


Are there any known bugs?
. Yes, there is.
. Once the PDF is zoomed and the next button is clicked the PDF goes out of the frame. There is a need to use a pinch
gesture to get it back into the frame.



***** I have modified apple's code on how to render a single pdf page******
