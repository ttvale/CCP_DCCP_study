#WabbitStudio

Repository for the WabbitStudio suite of tools. This project uses submodules for its dependencies, so be sure to include the `--recursive` flag when cloning, like so:

    git clone git@github.com:willbur1984/WabbitStudio.git --recursive

Afterwards, just open the `WabbitStudio.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
