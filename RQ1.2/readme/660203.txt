This is a fork of the open source agent simulation platform
"Gestalt". The original project can be found at
http://ngilasp.sourceforge.net . I was involved in the development of
the original platform and have forked the project to take it to new
fun places!

Gestalt is a agent based simulation platform. It is designed to run large scale agent based simulations by being highly modular. Everything in Gestalt is a module except for the most basic necessities. 

Gestalt was developed by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (http://cstep.in/) as a prototype for one of the projects.

"Gestalt" is a structure, configuration, or pattern of physical, biological, or psychological phenomena so integrated as to constitute a functional unit with properties not derivable by summation of its parts.
