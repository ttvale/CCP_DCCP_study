# Personal .emacs.d directory

All packages are managed by `package.el` using the
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) repository.  The `custom.el`
file contains all Emacs customizations that happen through the builtin
configuration tool and `init.el` is everything else that I've written.

## Directories

elisp
: this contains all stuff that is WIP and/or not in Marmalade yet.

autosave
: dummy container for a directory that causes Emacs to error if not
already around.

themes
: not obvious?
