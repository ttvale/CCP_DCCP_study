A bin packing algorithm for java.

There's no version. Call it 1.0 if you wish. I need to add test cases docs. 

If you look at the simple /src/main/test/com/acidblue/collections/binpack/Main.java class you can see how it is used.

For a definition of the problem domain go over to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem "Bin packing problem").
