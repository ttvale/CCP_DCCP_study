Dwolla OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-dwolla'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Dwolla` is simply a Rack middleware.
Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: 
<https://github.com/intridea/omniauth>.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app
in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` and getting a token with
scope permissions for full user info, send and request transactions:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :dwolla, ENV['DWOLLA_KEY'], ENV['DWOLLA_SECRET'], 
  :scope                  => 'accountinfofull|send|request',
  :provider_ignores_state => true
end
```

The `:scope` param is optional.

The default :scope is 'accountinfofull'. 
It is necessary in order to grab the uid and detailed info for user.

The extra hash will include:
```json
    "raw_info": {
        "City": "Des Moines",
        "Id": "812-111-1111",
        "Latitude": 41.584546,
        "Longitude": -93.634167,
        "Name": "Test User",
        "State": "IA",
        "Type": "Personal"
    }
```

## Exception Handling

If the Dwolla library raises a `Dwolla::RequestException`, 
that will be wrapped and re-raised as a 
`OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2::CallbackError`.  The OmniAuth OAuth2 
library will, in turn, treat that as a failure due to invalid 
credentials, passing the `CallbackError` through Rack's middleware chain.

Note that the `Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController` provides a 
good example of handling this scenario.

## Maintainer's Note

The [omniauth-dwolla gem](https://github.com/masukomi/omniauth-dwolla)
is currently maintained by masukomi ([GitHub](https://github.com/masukomi/), [web](http://masukomi.org/)). PRs will be happily accepted but 
the tests must still pass (and be updated if necessary). We're dealing 
with money here folks. We can't be careless. 

I'm [@masukomi on Twitter](https://twitter.com/masukomi) and that's the best 
way to contact me if you have any questions or ideas about this gem. My GitHub
notifications page is typically overflowing with stuff from work. ;)
