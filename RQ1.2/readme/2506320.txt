# Handle
Handle is an IRC client for Windows using the Metro design language and state-of-the-art technology.


According to the [80-20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) there is a good chance you only use 20% of your current client's features 80% of the time. 
_We have a laser sharp focus on those 20%._
