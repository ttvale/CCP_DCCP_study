***************** Building
Start by running the configure script:
# ./configure

You may pass some options to configure:

--disable-interpolation
	The highly advanced website metions that the interpolation 
	code may be the cause of some crashing issues some people have experienced.
	This options allows you to disable the interpolation code.

--enables-optimisations
	This options enables compiler optimisation. Some versions of gcc seem
	to enter an infinite memory consuming loop while compiling the emulation
	engine (due to extreme inlining), so optimisations are forcefully disabled.

# make all install

On a non GNU system, you should use:
# gmake all install

Enjoy!
