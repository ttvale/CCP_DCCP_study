PISHU - PIrate SHell Utility

== Description
A commandline download utility for thepiratebay.org

The script only downloads torrent files from thepiratebay.org - it is not a BitTorrent client.

The script provides two modes: one non-interactive and one interactive. If you intend to download the top result of a search the non-interactive mode is suffucient. However, this mode is not well suited for more selective searches. In this case it is better to choose the interactive search where multiple searches, search category changes, result listings and torrent downloads can be made.
