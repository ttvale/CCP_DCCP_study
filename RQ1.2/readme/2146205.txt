## REQUIREMENTS ##
##################
    * Java
    * Web browser (Chrome preferred, Firefox kinda supported)

## ARCHITECTURE ##
##################
This tool is designed to have a server run on some computer visible on the internet.  This computer
acts as the "master" and handles all of the administration.  It runs a web server through which the
user queues and views matches.  The user can install this software on an arbitrary number of 
"worker" computers that will actually run the matches.  The master receives the user commands, 
sends the appropriate matches to the workers, and they send back the results.  The more workers, 
the faster the results.

####################
## RUNNING SERVER ##
####################
The entry point is run.sh.  Use ./run.sh -h to view the options, but the basic way to start the
server is:

./run.sh -s
(run.bat -s on windows)

On the first run it will prompt you to create an admin user.  This is used for the web login.

#####################
## RUNNING WORKERS ##
#####################
The first run of the server will also generate a file named bs-worker.tar.gz.  You can either copy
this file by hand or download it via the web interface (under the Admin tab).  Once you have that
file on a worker machine, you simply unzip it and run it the same way you ran the server.  

./run.sh -w [hostname]
(run.bat -w [hostname] on windows)

where [hostname] is the address of the master.  If your machine has multiple cores you can also 
use the -c [cores] option to run multiple matches simultaneously.  Be warned that each running
match eats up a lot of memory.

While you *can* run both a master and a worker on the same computer, you should not run them from
the same directory.

#######################
# UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS #
#######################
Unzip the contents of bs-tester.tar.gz into your current install directory.  That should overwrite
all the necessary files.  You only need to do this to the server; the workers should all be
updated automatically afterwards.

If that does not work (or if you want to be extra-super-careful), unzip the new version into a new 
directory and copy over
static/matches
static/scrimmages
and all files that start with BSTesterDB
