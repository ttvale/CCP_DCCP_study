Description
===========

This program allows one to automatically scrape publications from Google Scholar,
starting from words to search ("osteoporosis", "we have never been modern") and
following the "Cited by" links. You can then export the graph of the publications.
 
Dependencies
============
- MongoDB
- ``scrapy``
- ``networkx``
- ``pystache``
- ``pymongo``
- ``levensthein``

How to install scholarScape
===========================

The first two steps (starred ones) are designed for a Debian based distribution as they involve installing packages (MongoDB and Scrapy) with apt-get. However MongoDB has packages in other distributions and you can install Scrapy from the sources. See in the "Read More" section the links to the install pages of these softwares.
 
The `last steps`__ should not be specific to any version of Linux.

__ `Fork some code`_

Tell me if you have or have resolved any problem and I will add your solution here.

\*Add some repositories first
-----------------------------

Execute this command to add Scrapy and MongoDB repositories to your /etc/apt/sources.list, be careful to change **DISTRO** to the name of your Ubuntu distribution ::

    sudo echo -e "deb http://archive.scrapy.org/ubuntu **DISTRO** main\ndeb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

You can get the name of your distribution by executing : ::

    cat /etc/lsb-release

and the line beginning by ``DISTRIB_CODENAME`` tells you the name of your version (ex : ``edgy``, ``natty``, ``lucid``) 

You'll want to update apt after having added repositories ::

    sudo apt-get update

\*Install them all
------------------

You can now install all the dependencies scholarScape relies upon. It is recommended to install ``virtualenv`` to set up a virtual environment in order not to disturb other programs. ::

    sudo apt-get install python-dev bzr mongodb-10gen scrapyd-0.15 git-core
    sudo easy_install virtualenv
    sudo easy_install scrapy 
    sudo easy_install pymongo 
    sudo easy_install pystache
    sudo easy_install python-levenshtein

    bzr branch lp:txjsonrpc
    cd txjsonrpc
    sudo python setup.py install
    cd ../
    rm -rf txjsonrpc/

    curl http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/n/networkx/networkx-1.6.tar.gz#md5=a5e62b841b30118574b57d0eaf1917ca | tar zx
    cd networkx-1.6
    sudo python setup.py install
    
Fork some code
--------------

The latest version of scholarScape is always available at `github <http://github.com/medialab/scholarScape/>`_. To clone the repository ::

    git clone https://github.com/medialab/scholarScape.git

You can put scholarScape anywhere you want but if you want to follow the Linux filesystem hierarchy 
(explained `here <http://serverfault.com/questions/96416/should-i-install-linux-applications-in-var-or-opt>`, you might 
want to put it in /usr/local/scholarScape/.

Setup Mongodb
-------------
Connect to MongoDB and add the user configured in ``config.json``, in the MongoDB part (user : ``scholarScape``, password : ``diabal`` by default) . ::
 
    ./mongo
    > use scholarScape
    > db.addUser("scholarScape", "diabal")

Setup a few directories
--------------------------
Create the directories where scholarScape will export the graphs. The adress can be relative
(to the directory where scholarScape.tac is) or absolute. By default, the export directory
is ``data/`` and graph files are exported under ``gexf/`` so you'll do : ::

    mkdir data data/gexf data/zip data/json

Launch the server
-----------------
Now you can launch the scholarScape server. Go to the source directory and execute this command ::

    cd scholarScape
    twistd -ny scholarScape.py

You can omit the parameter "n" if you want to start the server as a daemon.

Setup Apache
------------

Usually other ports than 80 are not available from outside. If you want your server to
 be available from outside, you can setup a reverse proxy in Apache. 
People then will be allowed to access scholarScape on `localhost/scholarScape` instead
of accessing on localhost

The file is named scholarScape-apache.conf.

You can use it by doing ::

    sudo cp scholarScape-apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/scholarScape
    sudo a2ensite scholarScape
    
You may want to change the port used in this file if you changed the default port in
scholarScape's config.

Usage
=====
After the installation you'll want to type in ``localhost:TWISTED_PORT`` in your
favorite browser and you will find the scholarScape's WebUI (``TWISTED_PORT`` is configured in your ``config.json``).

You can then follow the tutorial from
there.
