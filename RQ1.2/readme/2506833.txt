App::StatusSkein is a lifestream-style aggregator for Facebook,
Twitter, Identi.ca, and eventually other sorts of social media
networks.

Maybe the best explanation is to just look at it, it should be fairly
self-explanatory. Here's a screenshot:

It allows reading, posting, favoriting, re-tweeting/recycling, and
keeps track of post loads so you (hopefully) only see things that have
been newly posted since the last time you looked at a service.

Currently, the support for getting this to work yourself is lacking --
the initialization/setup and application authorization code still
needs to be written -- so if you want to play, you're going to need to
jump thru some hoops (or write that code...) Sorry about that, that's
on the list to get fixed Real Soon Now...
