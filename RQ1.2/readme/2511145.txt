This is the "D2 distributed database" D2DDB project.

Algo:
client daemon:
it polls the TrackingTable and pulls from it changes,
and save them into Queue table in aux-db,  and
clean those trackings-rows from TrackingTable immediately.

then it sorts/purges those changes and send to server.
ClientMessage[new_changes, acknowledge_of_previous_changes_from_server]

Todo:
- multi - filial code
- merging changes of both sides
- synhro from central to filial
- maybe refactor with a messaging framework
