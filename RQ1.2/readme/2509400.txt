I code the depot sample from the book "Agile web development with Rails 4th Edition"

All the Playtime sections are included.

Ruby 1.9.2 & Rails 3.1.3

You can download the original source code from the website: http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails

This is just a place to save my local work online.

A work in progress!
