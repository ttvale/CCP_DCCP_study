clipsmm: C++ bindings for CLIPS
===============================

CLIPS is a rule-based production system (or expert system) tool to develop
and run applications of knowledge representation and inference. For details
please visit http://clipsrules.sf.net.

CLIPS comes with support for close integration with the C programming
language. clipsmm provides a C++ API for these features allowing to interact
with a CLIPS environment (asserting facts, querying data etc.) and providing
functions for use in CLIPS. clipsmm relies on the sigc++ library to
connect C++ methods with CLIPS functions

The project was originally developed by Rick L. Vinyard. The project is now
maintained and updated by Tim Niemueller.

The documentation can be found on http://clipsmm.sf.net, the canonical code
repository is at https://github.com/timn/clipsmm.
