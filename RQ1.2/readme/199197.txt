SETTING UP THE VIDEO GALLERY

The download includes some sample photos and videos to get the Video Gallery up and running quickly. 

1. Upload the files to your server. 

2. Create a new database using the sample data in the database folder. 

3. Open application/config/config.php and change $config['base_url'] to point at the folder in which you've put the files. If you're not using mod_rewrite, change $config['index_page'] to 'index.php'. 

4. Open application/config/database.php and change $db['default']['username'], $db['default']['password'], $db['default']['database'] to match your settings. 

5. The .htaccess file in the Video Gallery main folder includes rules to redirect video and image requests to the samples included. If you don't want to use them, please remove these lines. Note that the included xmoov video streamer has also been lightly modified to support the placeholder videos. If you don't want this, please replace index.php with index.php.original in placeholder\videos.
