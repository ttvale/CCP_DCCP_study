This is my User Page on GitHub, a very small personal site that directs people either to my GitHub repository or my psersonal/professional webpage. This Jekyll site is built on the code from two different repositories:

1. [Jekyll Base](https://github.com/danielmcgraw/Jekyll-Base): This is a base that will a starting point for Jekyll, create by Daniel McGraw (@danielmcgraw). Check out [McGraw's post series](http://danielmcgraw.com/2011/04/14/The-Ultimate-Guide-To-Getting-Started-With-Jekyll-Part-1/) on how to use Jekyll Base to create a Jekyll powered site.

2. [Beautiful Web Type](https://github.com/ubuwaits/beautiful-web-type): Chad Mazzola created a site to demonstrate some great web fonts, and I used his site as a design template, as well as I used some of this code, which is [available]i(https://github.com/ubuwaits/beautiful-web-type/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE) for use.
