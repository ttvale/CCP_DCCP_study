mpeg-segmenter
=====================================

Starting from a MPEG-TS file, it segments the stream and prepares the M3U8 in according to
HTTP Live Streaming for iOS.

`mpeg-segmenter` allows you to generate a fully compliant HTTP Live Streaming video from a standard
video file (AVI, MP4, MKV, etc.)

Synopsis
--------
Apple recently defined a new standard for video streaming, currently as draft at 
[IETF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-07), called HTTP Live Streaming.

HTTP Live Streaming is the only protocol allowed for delivering video to iOS devices (i.e. iPhone, iPad and iPod).
It is based on top the HTTP protocol and leverages on MPEG TS format defined in the MPEG part 1 specification (ISO 13818-1).

General procedure
-----------------

Let's suppose we want to deliver a video for iOS devices and we have a file AVI, MP4, MKV or similar 
video clip. All we need to do is:

1. Convert the video in TS format. I strongly suggest to use `ffmpeg`.
2. Use `mpeg-segmenter` to prepare the TS segments and M3U8 files.
3. Copy the output files (`.ts` and `.m3u8` files) generated by `mpeg-segmenter` in your preferred web
   server and make them available for download.
4. Open Safari from your iOS and open the web location of main M3U8 file.
5. Watch your VIDEO!

A typical flow involves these different actors which act in the following way:

Installation
------------

A 1.9.x Ruby platform is required.

    gem install pkg/mpeg-segmenter-0.3.0.gem

After installation, you can decide to use `mpeg-segmenter' as Ruby library or use its command line interface composed by 
the following executables:

* `mpeg-segmenter`. It segments a TS file in multiple files time aligned.
    
* `m3u8-playlist-generator`. It generates the variant playlist (main m3u8 file).

Encoding
-------------
We strongly suggest to use last version of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

FFmpeg is a powerful encoder let you to generate .TS files from your preferred video format (.AVI, .MP4, etc.).
