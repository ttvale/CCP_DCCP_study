KNOWN ISSUES:

There is a bug in Java release 6u29 (and some versions of 7.x); it contains a broken version of
rmiregistry that doesn't recogize codebase commands with file:/ parameters. This will manifest as
an exception when running TwEater that says "access to class loader denied". The only known fix
is to update to a more recent version of Java.
