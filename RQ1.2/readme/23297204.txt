**OntoComPlib** is a library for completing OWL ontologies. It is mainly developed for the ontology completion tool OntoComP, which is a plugin for the [Protégé 4](https://protege.stanford.edu/) ontology editor. **OntoComPlib** is an extension of the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) library FCAlib. It implements the ontology completion algorithm presented in [1]. It communicates with the reasoner over the [OWL API](https://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/).
