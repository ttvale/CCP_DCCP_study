# Shell Library

This repo is a dumping ground for various *bash* and *zsh* functions I've
built over the years. It's in a separate repository from my normal *bash* and
*zsh* dotfiles, because my dotfiles contain stuff that is machine-specific
and not at all general-purpose. By contrast, these files are intended to be
general-purpose, suitable for anyone to use, if crazy enough to want to do so.

## Disclaimer

You are free to crib from these, or even steal them outright. But I don't
support them, except for myself, so you're on your own. Obviously, the standard
disclaimers apply (use at your own risk; if you use them, and your system
catches fire, it's not my fault; no warranty; blah blah blah).
