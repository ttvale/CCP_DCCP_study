# AjaxController

Automatically support ajax requests from popular Javascript libraries without any more thought.

## Background

In the process of writing a new tutorial for CakePHP 2.0, I realized some of the stuff I was writing could be abstracted into it's own self-contained class. I did so, and moved the logic into the AppController.

Recently I was working on a side-project that would need ajax-enabled JSON responses in CakePHP 1.3. With my previous experience, I knew doing this was possible, but rather than copy-pasting the same code over and over, I rewrote it into a plugin for future reuse and abuse.

## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x
* PHP 5.3

## Installation

_[Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)]_

Add the plugin to your project's `composer.json` - something like this:

    {
      "require": {
          "josegonzalez/cakephp-ajax-controller": "dev-master"
      }
    }

Because this plugin has the type `cakephp-plugin` set in it's own `composer.json`, composer knows to install it inside your `/Plugins` directory, rather than in the usual vendors file. It is recommended that you add `/Plugins/AjaxController` to your .gitignore file. (Why? [read this](http://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).)

_[Manual]_

* Download this: [http://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-ajax-controller/zipball/master](http://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-ajax-controller/zipball/master)
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `app/Plugin`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `AjaxController`

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:

  git submodule add -b master git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-ajax-controller.git Plugin/AjaxController
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

_[GIT Clone]_

In your `Plugin` directory type:

  git clone -b master git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-ajax-controller.git AjaxController

### Enable plugin

In 2.0 you need to enable the plugin your `app/Config/bootstrap.php` file:

  CakePlugin::load('AjaxController');

If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();`, then this is not necessary.

## Usage

Place the following code in your `app/app_controller.php`:

```
App::import('Lib', 'AjaxController.AjaxController');
class AppController extends AjaxController {
}
```

When making Ajax Requests that prefer JSON, the `AjaxController` will automatically convert the entire response into json. Please note that this also includes the view variables that would normally be set. If you'd like to hide any data, do not set it for the view.

This also handles all redirects properly, so your ajax request will be able to perform as a regular request might.

In order to disable JSON responses for Ajax requests, you can either set `$this->_disableAjax = true;` or call `$this->_disableAjax()` with an array of actions to disable JSON responses for.


```
App::import('Lib', 'AjaxController.AjaxController');
class AppController extends AjaxController {
}
class PostsController extends AppController {
    function beforeFilter() {
        $this->_disableAjax('index', 'view');
    }

    function edit() {
        $this->_disableAjax = true;
    }
}
```

## TODO:

* Unit Tests
* Provide XML responses when desired
