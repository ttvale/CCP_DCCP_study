### smpair
Still in early development, `smpair` is a library that implements [Swiss
McMahon Pairing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon_system_tournament) 
using [Weighted Perfect Matching](http://jorisvr.nl/maximummatching.html). 
As of August 2011, it can pair only the first round of a tournament. When
it is capable of handling multiple rounds, I hope to release it as a gem.

### Usage
Run `bundle exec ./example.rb` with no arguments to get usage instructions.
