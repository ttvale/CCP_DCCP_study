This was one of the preliminary projects I worked on iOS platform. The objective was to explore custom user interfaces with custom animations and interactions.


A very simple user interface. Can be used to learn about:

2. Custom UIAlertView
3. Timers
4. Queue
5. .plist files and their importance
6. UIView animations
7. Custom design using nib
8. Custom UITableViewCell
