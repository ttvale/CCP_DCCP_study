Gateman
-------

Gateman is a simple daemon intended to interact with physical hardware locks.
Currently, it only supports two platforms:
- Simply interacting with a gate at the [Noisebridge Hackerspace's](https://noisebridge.net/) front gate through a parallel port.
- Ethernet-Arduino (Wiznet/"Ethernet.h") based bit-banger and ring detector.
