A [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) & [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) joint.

## Things to Note

If you donâ€™t have `gsl` installed (currently a `brew` install of `1.14`, not `1.15`,
is good if you're on OS X), then generation will run a bit more slowly, but you _can_
remove or comment it out of the Gemfile.

If you want to use `foreman` there's a `Procfile` that will invoke Jekyll, Compass
and run the Sinatra app.
