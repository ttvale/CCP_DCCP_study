Introduction
============

See 0.0.6 README for old info: https://github.com/AnnanFay/dgc/blob/04b1673d59fedaf3dfa9f004d1700f471268dca6/README

This is left blank so I don't forget to fill it in.

Building
========

Building requires leiningen and java.

If you are building it from dfhack follow the dfhack build instructions insuring that BUILD_DGC is set.

If you are building it without dfhack run:

    lein uberjar

Then copy the generated standalone jar file and data directory to wherever you wish to install.

Usage
=====

Don't

Or if you do, just use the example Dwarves.json. Because it's currently built by dfjson which isn't in complete working order.
