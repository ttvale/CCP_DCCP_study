# UIView+DrawRectBlock

Tired of subclassing UIView just to implement drawRect?

This is a category on UIView to create an instance with a block for its drawRect.


## How do I use this?

Something like this:

    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [self.view addSubview:[UIView viewWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 40, 60, 60)
                                      drawRectBlock:^(UIView *drawRectView, CGRect rect) {
                                          CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
                                          CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(c, [UIColor blueColor].CGColor);
                                          CGContextFillRect(c, rect);
                                      }]];
    }

But, of course, always be careful around blocks. This setup makes it really easy to create a circular reference chain.
Say you want to access a property on the viewcontroller, like that color, so you do something like this:

    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [self.view addSubview:[UIView viewWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 40, 60, 60)
                                      drawRectBlock:^(UIView *drawRectView, CGRect rect) {
                                          CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
                                          CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(c, self.fillColor.CGColor);
                                          CGContextFillRect(c, rect);
                                      }]];
    }

Now the block will retain the viewcontroller, the viewcontroller will retain the view and the view will retain the block, which in turn retains the view...

If you're using iOS 5 and ARC, you can do something like this:

    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        __weak MyViewController *weakRef = self;
        [self.view addSubview:[UIView viewWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 40, 60, 60)
                                      drawRectBlock:^(UIView *drawRectView, CGRect rect) {
                                          CGContextRef c = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
                                          CGContextSetFillColorWithColor(c, weakRef.fillColor.CGColor);
                                          CGContextFillRect(c, rect);
                                      }]];
    }
