The MC HCK!
===========

The goal is to have a small, cheap, and powerful development board
that supports USB for easy programming, at a low price (current
estimate: $7, target $5). This allows us to use the board for all
silly purposes where spending >$20 for other microcontroller boards is
just too much.

The schematic design and layout was done using KiCad <http://kicad.sourceforge.net>,
a Free Software EDA tool for Linux, Windows and Mac OS.  You will need
KiCad to open the .sch or .brd files - gEDA or Eagle will not work.

Fabrication outputs

If you got this from the git repository, you should be able to find
fabrication outputs in the "fab" branch.  This branch gets updated by
running `make ci-fab`.
