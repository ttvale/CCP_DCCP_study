Topgun: Android based jet game. You control the plane to dodge the bullets and try to survive as long as possible. I created the game four years ago started without any knowledge in android development. Put it in the market two years ago, which is not well received :-(. Now I think I could share it for android starters' reference :--)  

The game is based on google android sample application: lunar landing. You could use the trackball, or keyboard, or sensor to control the airplane to dodge the bullets coming at you. Try to survice as long as possible.
