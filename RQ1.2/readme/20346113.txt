Chinese Polar Races - Learn Mandarin with audio, characters and Pinyin in this flashcard type game

A Java applet game I wrote back in 1999 for fun during college as a way to help memorize vocabulary for 1st year Chinese class at UC Irvine. It became popular and helped out a lot of other students that year as well.
