NB: As of November 1, 2013, PPCHiG is no longer under development. Anyone is free to pick up the project (please do!), and you may contact me with questions about the current state of the corpus (although please read the section "Known Issues" in the annotation manual first) or for advice about continuing the development of the corpus. I may not be able to respond quickly, but I will try my best to respond eventually.

The Penn Parsed Corpus of Historical Greek is a set of software tools for developing a treebank and a treebank that is developed using the same tools. The treebank will contain Greek texts from the Homeric, Classical, New Testament, and Hellenistic periods of the language.
