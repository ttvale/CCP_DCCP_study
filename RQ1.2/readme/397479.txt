Ebenezer v0.1 "Tiny Tim"

Command line personal accounting tool

Use with python main.py [filename]

Currently, all output is saved in the initially loaded file, which is backupped as filename.backup at the start of the application. If no file is given when launching the application, the user will be asked for a filename when exiting the program.

Better file support (and in-application loading/saving is of course planned).
