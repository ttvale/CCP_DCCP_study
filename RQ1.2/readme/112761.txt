Dotfiles
========

Various personal config files adopted from countless sources and then
customized to various degrees.

Sources
-------

Some sources from which my dotfile derived.  This list is not complete and is
really more for my personal reference than for accreditation.

- [zenazn](https://github.com/zenazn/dotfiles), for some basic initial config,
  some choices of bundles, the install script and profile.d layout, and the
  screen/ssh hijinks.
- [trapd00r](https://github.com/trapd00r/configs/tree/master/vim), for Cabbrev
  and some other neat vim tricks.
- Various sources at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Engineering) for
  whitespace removal, the use of cstag, and other tricks (and for inventing
  XHP).
