# PLEASE NOTE: DEPRECATED

This `iframe` hack is probably obviated by the introduction (2012-09-01) of [CORS support in S3](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html).
As such, I don't guarantee that the demo site will remain up and running.

## The Problem ##

This mini-project was born when I moved [a site](http://www.provensecuritysolutions.com) from standard GoDaddy hosting to Amazon S3's static site hosting. The site has a couple of directories of downloads that it had been directly browsable using `.htaccess` permissions. But that ability was lost with S3.

When looking for a solution to this problem, [I found that it's possible](https://aws.amazon.com/code/Amazon-S3/1713) if you're accessing access the bucket as a bucket-domain (`www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com`); but cross-domain restrictions prevent that from working if you're using the bucket as a website (`www.example.com`, CNAME'd to something like `www.example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`). (The solution to this problem would be much easier and cleaner if AWS enabled/provided [the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=34281&start=125&tstart=0).)

After much cross-domain failure I hit on the idea of using an `iframe` that is loaded directly from the bucket, so it's in the same domain as the S3 REST call we ultimately want to do.

## A Solution ##

In this project you'll find two files: `index.html` and `s3_file_list_iframe.html`. The former loads the latter into an `iframe`. Because the `iframe` source is from the same domain as the 

When `index.html` is loaded in a browser, the user will be shown an expandable tree of all directories and files located under the current directory (and its subdirectories). 

## Usage ##

1. `index.html` should be renamed to whatever you've configured the "Index Document" to be in your S3 website bucket. 

2. Copy the files into the directory that you'd like to provide a listing for. 

3. Make sure that the bucket has *List* permission for *Everyone*, and that the files are publicly readable.

## Compatibility ##

I've tested on Windows with Chrome, Firefox, and IE9.

If you're trying to use *s3-file-list-page* in conjunction with [*FuseOverAmazon*](http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/wiki/FuseOverAmazon), you should look at [this (solved) issue](https://github.com/adam-p/s3-file-list-page/issues/1).

## Shortcomings ##

- You have to give you bucket public list permission, which might not be a great idea. See [Amazon S3 Bucket Public Access Considerations](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/5050).

- JavaScript is required. There's just no way around it. So no graceful degradation.

- It would have been nice to use HTTPS when accessing the bucket directly, but there's a cert mismatch with www.example.com.s3.amazonaws.com, so no dice.

- It would be good if `index.html` could get its own filename rather than using "index.html" explicitly when there's no filename in the location URL (i.e., when the "Index Document" is being hit). I couldn't figure out how to discover the implicit filename. So if you're using something other than "index.html" for your index filename, you should probably edit the `?ignore=` part of the `iframe src`.
