# Welcome to couchdb-conduit

This is a CouchDB client library for the Haskell programming language.

# Testing against secured CouchDB

If your CouchDB not in Admin Party, you need to set credentials. Just set 
needed login and password in module `CouchDBAuch`:

    login = "yourLogin"
    pass = "yourPass"

or leave them `empty`
