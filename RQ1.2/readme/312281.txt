We're enthusastic about the response to our prototype and product design - so our team is committed to pushing this
project forward to a full scale trial.

# Join our Team

We are seeking partners and helpers:

1. We are looking for potential program *Sponsors* to administer a pilot test serving their homeless clients.
2. We could use more help in developing our software and realizing the full extent of our design work over the
   weekend.  If you have experience with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, or App Engine, we'd love to have your help.

We meet each Wednesday night (beginning January 25th, 2011) to coordinate activities of our working group.  You can
join us in person or via Google Plus Hangout.  Contact mckoss@startpad.org if you'd like to join us.
