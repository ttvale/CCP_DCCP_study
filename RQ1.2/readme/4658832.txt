Experimental project to build desktop application in Ruby via JRuby.

Combines a SWING Java desktop, designed with Netbeans GUI builder, but almost exclusively implemented in Ruby code.

ADAM concept is Asset Definition and Manipulation, enabling user to define database assets via XSD, XML, Excel, CSV etc,
and then manage the transformation, import or export of such assets from populated databases.

Use cases include migration of data between databases, or between databases and applications, 
export/import of data requiring complex transformations as part of the process.


### Development

The main application Swing Window is in src/AdamMDIApplication.java

Double click to edit in the Netbeans Swing GUI Editor

Any GUI code that could not be written in JRuby, is in 

    lib/autotelik/autotelik/swing
    src/app/java

### Gems and loading

https://github.com/monkeybars/monkeybars-core/wiki/Use-ruby-gems-in-your-application

gems are unpacked into lib/ruby e.g download builder gem save to lib/ruby

    cd lib/ruby

    jruby -S gem unpack builder.1.2.3

    # Now rename the builder directory to remove any version info.
    mv builder.1.2.3 builder

    
The main.rb file manages app init with manifest.rb setting load paths

### Installation Details

Requires Netbeans


Uses MonkeyBars : https://github.com/monkeybars/monkeybars-core

To install the monkeybars gem yourself :

gem sources -a http://gems.neurogami.com

gem i monkeybars


Uses jruby-complete.jar : http://jruby.org



### TODO

JXTree is now broken since upgrading gems and jars, so some aspect of GUI now totally broken.

Investigating QuickTable as a replacement : http://java.net/projects/quicktable/downloads

Currently only runs from Netbeans Run Menu (F6)

This is related to the manifest, there are two situations from filesystem
or from jar. Netbeans triggers the filesystem optionms which I have concentrated on.

Running from a jar requires different load paths.

Work out how to use the Debugger, is it possible to break in Ruby code ?


XSD Parser is nice idea but implementation bit naff and terribly slow for very large XSDs
