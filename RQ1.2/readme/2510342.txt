jmoiron.net
===========

This humble project is a dabble with Flask and somewhat of an educational
experiment in how using microframeworks might work for small but not
trivial applications.  There is a particular focus in attempting to keep
project organization somewhat loosely coupled while also exploring what is
idiomatic to Flask (and by extension similar microframeworks).

It's a port of the code that operates `jmoiron.net`_, from `django`_ and
`postgresql`_ to `flask`_ and `mongodb`_, with a few other major version
changes thrown in.  It uses `micromongo`_ for mongo access.
