RESTful GORM README file
------------------------

This is a work in progress. The current aim of this project is to provide the
following capabilities out of the box:

/api/domain-class 
  A list of all domain class instances
/api/domain-class/id
  A representation of domain class instance with the given id
/api/domain-class/id/relation
  A list of instances or instance pointed to by the given relation
/api/domain-class/id1/relation/id2
  An instances pointed to by the given relation if it is a list
?query=field:op:value
  An option to filter instances by a given criteria (GET only).
  Initially the same set of operators should be supported that are available
  in criteria queries
?max=value
  An option to return not more than a given numer of results (paging)
?offset=value
  An option to skip the given number of results (paging)
?order=field
  An option to sort results by a given field

Other than that the following HTTP actions will be supported:

GET /api/domain-class 
  List of instances 
POST /api/domain-class/
  Create a new instance
PUT /api/domain-class/
  Replace the whole list
DELETE /api/domain-class/
  Delete all instances

GET /api/domain-class/id
  Given instances 
POST /api/domain-class/id
  Denied
PUT /api/domain-class/id
  Replace the given instance
DELETE /api/domain-class/id
  Delete the given instance instances

And so on with regard to all relations.

The following input/output formats shall be supported:

- XML
- JSON

Other data exchange formats just don't make sense in this context.
