			   [ maven-archetype-bukkit ]

maven-archetype-bukkit is an Apache Maven archetype for Bukkit plugins.

				   [ Usage ]

If you're using Maven from the command line, first build and install the
archetype into your local repository:

$ mvn clean install

Then, in the directory where you'd like your new plugin's directory to
be created:

$ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local

And select maven-archetype-bukkit from the list. You'll then be prompted to
configure the new project. Along with the standard properties of groupId,
artifactId, version, and package, you'll be asked to supply your name and email
address as well as a prefix to use for your plugin's in-game commands. The name
and email address you supply will be used in the copyright header in the
generated source files as well as in the project's POM. For example:

Define value for property 'groupId': : me.brjannc.plugins
Define value for property 'artifactId': : Example
Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT: : 
Define value for property 'package':  me.brjannc.plugins: : me.brjannc.plugins.example
Define value for property 'authorEmail': : brjannc at gmail.com
Define value for property 'authorName': : brjannc

You'll then be asked to verify the properties; if everything looks good, say 'Y'
and the new project will be created.

If you're using NetBeans, open the archetype project, ignore the fact that
everything looks broken (NetBeans doesn't understand archetypes, apparently),
and just clean and build. Then open the "New Project" dialog, select "Maven" and
"Project from Archetype", then click "Next". In the "Local Archetype Catalog"
section, select maven-archetype-bukkit and click "Next". Then fill in the
properties (as described above), click "Finish", and the new project will be
created.
