Object Oriented File Wrapper for C++

All the header files should be documented pretty well, so if you read those,
you'll be able to figure out how to use the File class. The rest of this is
just me talking about the project.

The aim of this project is to create... well you get the idea. I was getting
fed up with the C-style stdio.h FILE* nonsense, so I thought it would be a good
learning experience to try and see if there wasn't some way to clean it up a
bit, while adding features I thought might be useful.

The way the File class is implemented is very simple. It's essentially just an
internal character buffer that gets filled when a file is opened. The max size
of a file that I can open is unfortnuately 4 GB, but since this project doesn't
aim to be a one-stop-shop for ALL C++ file management, I figure that's good
enough. At the very least, it's good enough for me.

I'm working towards adding all the fWhatever functions to the class so that it
is able to be used just like a FILE*.

Why not just use fstream? Because I wanted to try to learn how they were
implemented through trial and error, and because I find streams tedious. At any
rate, I'm far more familiar with the C-style functions than I am with the
stream functions.

Anyways, that's the aim of the project. Hopefully you can learn as much as I am
from it.
