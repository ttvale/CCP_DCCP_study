About:       mirodark extends Jason W Ryan's miromiro(1) Vim color file with gVim, Linux console,
             xterm-88color, and xterm-256color support. mirodark uses Jason W Ryan's dark(2)
             terminal color scheme colors. mirodark uses Henry So, Jr.'s desert256(3) color
             approximation functions.

Usage
=====

Installation:

1) Add mirodark.vim to your ~/.vim/colors directory.
2) Add the following to your ~/.vimrc file:

    syntax on
    colorscheme mirodark

Terminal Support:

mirodark uses color approximation functions to support xterm-88color and xterm-256color. If you
are not using xterm-88color or xterm-256color, then follow these instructions to set up your
terminal to use mirodark's color scheme. Also, if you are using xterm-88color or xterm-256color
but you want your terminal to use mirodark's color scheme, then follow these instructions.

1) If you are using a terminal that sets its color settings based on your ~/.Xresources file, like
   xterm or rxvt-unicode, then add the following to your ~/.Xresources file. If you are not using
   a terminal that sets its color settings based on your ~/.Xresources file, like gnome-terminal
   or konsole, then set its color settings to the following color values manually.

Linux Console Support:

    #
    # Linux Console Color Scheme: dark
    #
    # Maintainer: Jason W Ryan <http://jasonwryan.com/>
    #
    if [[ $TERM == "linux" ]]; then
        echo -en "\033]P0000000" # black
        echo -en "\033]P85e5e5e" # darkgray
        echo -en "\033]P18a2f58" # darkred

        echo -en "\033]Pe47959e" # lightcyan
        echo -en "\033]P7899ca1" # lightgray
        echo -en "\033]Pfc0c0c0" # white
    fi

Enable Higher Contrast Mode:

NOTE: Enabling Higher Contrast Mode only affects mirodark in xterm-256color and xterm-88color,
      assuming you did not disable color approximation, and gVim.

1) Add the following to your ~/.vimrc file, before 'colorscheme mirodark':

    let g:mirodark_enable_higher_contrast_mode=1

2) If you want to easily toggle Higher Contrast Mode on and off, then add the following to your
   ~/.vimrc file:

    nnoremap <Leader>m :MirodarkToggleHigherContrastMode<CR>
