This is a simple little Galaga clone that I wrote while I was taking a
Java course over the Summer in 2011 at NKU. My first "big" project and I
haven't even looked at the code since July, so, this is one for
the archives. Also, I hate Java with a bleeding passion. I may port this
to another language in the future however.
