Imagine you have an Active Record model like:

  class TicketSale < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

You can just include each of the callbacks depending on your needs:


  class TicketSale < ActiveRecord::Base
    include ActiveRecordToSimpledb::Callbacks::Create
  end


=== not yet done, but it'll in the future

  class TicketSale < ActiveRecord::Base
    include ActiveRecordToSimpledb::Callbacks::Update
    include ActiveRecordToSimpledb::Callbacks::Delete
  end
