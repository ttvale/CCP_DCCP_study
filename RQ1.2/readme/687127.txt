Introduction
============

The GRAND UNIFIED REGULARIZED LEAST SQUARES software library comprises the following packages.

-GURLS, a MATLAB software library for regression and (multiclass) classification 
 based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function. 
 Datasets that fit into your computer's memory should be handled with this package.

-bGURLS (b is for big), a MATLAB software library that allows to use RLS on very large
 matrices by means of memory-mapped storage and a simple distributed task manager.

-GURLS++, a C++ standalone implementation of GURLS, with additional simple API's for specific learning pipelines

-bGURLS++, a  C++ standalone implementation of bGURLS.
