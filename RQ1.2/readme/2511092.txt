A library for making Snake games in Javascript and Canvas/HTML5.
It provides basic customisation support:
* 1 or 2 players
* Visual timer
* Visual score
* You decide what element to use for displaying information
* Give the snake a name
* Decide snake color

You get score depending on how long you are.
The game has 3 different colored fruit:
* Blue only lengthens the snake
* Green only gives score
* Red gives both score and length

A minimal setup could be:
MinimalGame = SnakeLib;
MinimalGame.HTML.Canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
MinimalGame.Init();
MinimalGame.StartGame();

This will start a singleplayer game with a black snake called "Snake".
There will be no timelimit.

SnakeLib.HTML.Canvas is mandatory and must be set before running Init();
It must be a canvas HTML element.

Following settings are optional (Score2 is only needed if MultiPlayer is true):
* SnakeLib.Settings.MultiPlayer = bool;
* SnakeLib.Player.Color = string;
* SnakeLib.Player.Name = string;
* SnakeLib.Settings.ShowTimer = bool;
** SnakeLib.Settings.Timer = seconds or "infinity";
** SnakeLib.HTML.Timer = HTML element;
* SnakeLib.Settings.ShowScore = bool;
** SnakeLib.HTML.Score1 = HTML element;
** SnakeLib.HTML.Score2 = HTML element;
