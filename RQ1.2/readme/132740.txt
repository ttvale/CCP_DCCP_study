This program is a usb duplicator. It emulates the functionality of dd
by doing block level writes. Due to time constraints, the program only
copies to one usb. 

Notes:
the program has to be run as root
the menu seems to be not working, but selecting by number works.
the whole file selection for destination usbs is a hack, but I couldn't
figure out libusb in time.

The program exits as soon as it finishes copying.


Acknowledgments:
This program was created for "I Heart Engineering" and as part of a
final project for CS82010. It benefited from feedback and advice from
William Morris, the owner of I Heart Engineering.
