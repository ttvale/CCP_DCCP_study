Introduction
============
HAPviewer is a host application profile graphlet viewer. It visualizes
network data through graphs on a per-host level in such a way that
running applications are apparent. Moreover, it summarizes groups of 
flows in an intelligent way providing aggregates of per-role traffic.
Supported roles are: client, server, multi-clients and variations of
peer-to-peer.
