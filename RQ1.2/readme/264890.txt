New-EagerZeroHardDisk.ps1 - Contains a PowerShell function called 
                            New-EagerZeroHardDisk which provides a way to create
                            a new hard disk on an ESX/ESXi server that is zeroed
                            out at the time of creation, rather than over time.
                            Sometimes this is referred to as EagerlyScrub or
                            EagerZero. Required for Fault Tolerance.  Some
                            documents suggest that zeroing a disk up front
                            provides for better performance.  I have not tested
                            this theory.

                            To install:
                            Download file to a folder (e.g. C:\temp)
                            In PowerShell, import the script:
                             PS C:\> . C:\temp\New-EagerZeroHardDisk.ps1

                            Afterwards, you can view the help by typing:
                             PS C:\> help New-EagerZeroHardDisk -Full
