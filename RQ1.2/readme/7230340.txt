* Description
  This repository provides .nfo files for XBMC as well as a rename
  script so you can add the yearly CCC to XBMC as a show.

  Each congress maps to a season (e.g. 28c3 -> Season 28).

* Usage
  This set of files expects the following file structure for the downloaded talks:
  `/some_folder_for_the_c3/Sxx/*.mp4`.

  1) Copy /tvshow.nfo of this repository to `/some_folder_.../`
  2) Copy /Sxx/{*.nfo,rename.sh} of this repository to
     `/some_folder_.../Sxx/`
  3) Go to `/some_folder_.../Sxx/` and execute `rename.sh`. This fixes
     incorrect IDs in the file names as well as makes sure that XBMC
     will detect them.

* Caveats
  This set of files only works for the H.264 HQ versions of the talks,
  but making them work for the LQ or WebM versions just requires an
  intelligent rename command.

  Also, the first congress I have been doing this for is the 28c3, so
  there won't be any files for older congresses, for now.
