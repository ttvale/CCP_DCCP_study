Volume Rendering Example Code
Brandon Pelfrey - January 2011

This code is part of an ongoing tutorial on my blog @ brandonpelfrey.com/blog.
I will organize the lessons into separate folders and comment as much of the code as possible
in an attempt to supplement the tutorial text.

-- Building
This example requires ImageMagick's C++ bindings. 

Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev
Fedora: yum install ImageMagick-c++-devel

After that, all that is needed in order to build is to run make. The executable is placed in the
"bin" folder.
