=== Description ===
This is a small chess engine and AI I wrote for kicks. It's designed to work
with XBoard (run with ./rooked) but has silly command line abilities for
2-player and AI games.

=== Goals ===
Simple board that supports most legal moves (not castling until I'm really
bored), small move generator and a simple evaulation function. I'd like to
optimize move ordering later on so alpha-beta pruning is more effective. In the
end I'd like the AI to be better than I am. So far, it doesn't do too well.

=== TODO ===
 * Add pawn promotion to board.c
 * Add endgame evaluation/more aggressive mating late game
 * Continue strengthening early and midgame evaluation
