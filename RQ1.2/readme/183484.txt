pix_freenect (0.10)
======================================
Pure Data / Gem external to get Kinect camera streams

* depends on libfreenect (v0.1 !!)

Output RGB and Depth stream simultaneously from multiple Kinect sensors
Tested with 2 Kinects, should work with more (on different usb controllers)

::INSTALL::
tested and compiled for Ubuntu 11.10, MacOS 10.6.8 and Windows 7 with Gem 0.93.3

use binaries from build folder or build yourself
OSX: make sure that .dylib's provided in build folder are in the same folder than pix_freenect.pd_darwin!

*	get/install pd and Gem (0.93.2) including src (http://puredata.info)

*	get and install latest libfreenect from https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect
	(compile with Audio support!)

help with compiling:
	#...> git clone https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect.git
	#...> cd libfreenect
	#.../libfreenect> mkdir build
	#.../libfreenect> cd build
	#.../libfreenect/build> ccmake ../
	--> choose BUILD_AUDIO   ON
	--> choose BUILD_EXAMPLES   OFF     (ON only if you have GLUT)
	CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES  i386;x86_64
	press [c] (configure), [g] generate, [q] exit
	
	#.../libfreenect/build> cmake ../
	#.../libfreenect/build> make
	#.../libfreenect/build> sudo make install
	
*	rename Makefile in pix_freenect folder for your platform to Makefile and edit it for right path to Gem and pd sources

*	#.../pix_freenect> make


*	have a look at the pix_freenect-help.pd file!


_______________
:::CHANGELOG:::

0.10	* various bugfixes
		* no more init trick has to be made. streams should start and restart reliable!
		* audio support moved to separate external freenect_audio

0.04	* open specific kinect by serial number -> external lists all available kinect sensors with serial number on startup
	-> now you can be sure you use the right kinect if two or more plugged to the computer
	* output registered depth map --> rgb and depth are matching (depthmap gets a little bit smaller)
	-> includes the output of depthmap in [mm] distance as 16 bit value packed into r and g color channel
	* option to change resolution of rgb image to 1280x1024 -> slows down transfer!
	* various improvements to help file

0.03	* output rgb and depth stream simultaneously
	* output 4 channel audio as list on linux (experimental)
	* libfreenect v0.1 -> not backward compatible!!
	* binary for osx -> thanks to hans-christoph steiner for makefiles
	* accelerator output
	* different depth output modes (raw for distance measurement)
		
	
0.02	* compatibility to Gem 0.93
