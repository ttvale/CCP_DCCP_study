#backbone starter kit

i usually find something like backbone and want to get started with it but i hate having to assemble my work environment. here's one put together from the html5 boilerplate and backbone/underscore.

in addition, it also includes the docs for both underscore and backbone so if you're offline (i.e. "i'm on a boat") you can hack and look up some docs easily. enjoy!
