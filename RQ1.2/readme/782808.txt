This project is simply a thin wrapper around the Cytoscape Web API.  Include it 
in your project as you would a normal GWT module.

**Configuration**
- Library is by default set to use the human-readable javascript files to 
  assist with debugging.  To change over to the minimized files to improve
  performance, edit the CytoscapeWeb.gwt.xml file.

**Known Issues**
- Project has issues, with Firefox 4+, but not Firefox 3.6.  The problem likely
  has to do with the frame that Flash gets put into.  See my Google Group
  discussion link at the bottom of the README.
- Wrapper is perhaps too thin, as many of the parameters are simply GWT's 
  JavaScriptObject.  More objects should be created to simplify interaction
  with the library.  Prefer the methods with String parameters to simplify
  things.
- Based on Version 0.7.3, which is dated.  API should be updated to open up the
  features of the latest releases.
