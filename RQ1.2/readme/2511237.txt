## Install using Homebrew

On macOS with the `brew` command it's easy:

```
$ brew install svendahlstrand/tap/supervision
```

## Install the "hard" way

Just download the file [supervision][1], make it executable and place it somewhere in your path. Like this:

```bash
$Â curl -O https://raw.github.com/svendahlstrand/supervision/master/bin/supervision && chmod +x supervision
```

### Prerequisites

On Linux you may have to install [davfs2][2].

And of course it helps to have a copy and license for SiteVision. ;)

## Install a SiteVision version manually

The easiest way to install a new SiteVision version is by running `supervision install`. All versions are located in the directory `~/.supervision/versions`, so it's not hard to install manually. Just download and unpack.

When you `ls` the `versions` directory it should look something like this:

```bash
$ ls -1 ~/.supervision/versions/
3.6.7-49
4.0.1-26
4.0.2-40
4.0.3-41
4.1-beta
```
