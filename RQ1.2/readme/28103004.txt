Banshee is a demonstration of OpenGL cross-process rendering on Android in C++. There's a host app and a renderer app. The host is a standard Android NDK app, and the renderer is a command-line C++ app (i.e. not a normal Android app). The host and renderer coordinate rendering over IPC sockets. During initialization the renderer creates a pair of surfaces of the same size as the host's window, and sends the surface handles back to the host as file descriptors in an IPC message. When the host needs to draw a frame, it asks the renderer to draw to one of its surfaces, then the result is rendered into the actual Android window.
