Codejam Solutions
=================

My solutions to google codejam problems.

And that's it.

Running problems
----------------

All solutions use STDIN and STDOUT, so basically:

	$ ./problem < A-small-practice.in > A-small-practice.out

You have to download the inputs from the Google Codejam Site.
