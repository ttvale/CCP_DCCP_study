# walkah.net

This is my personal [blog](http://walkah.net/). I am treating it as an [open source project](http://walkah.net/blog/blogging-as-an-open-source-project/). Want to help out? Check out `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Colophon

The site is built using [Octopress 3.0](http://octopress.org/) (and therefore [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)) currently hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

I use [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) (and therefore [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)) for CSS styling. The design is my own.

The [main feed](http://feeds.walkah.net/walkah) is hosted by [FeedPress](https://feed.press/), but since nobody reads RSS anymore, I use [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) to send things to social media.
