	This file contains the release notes for bnetd version 0.4.25.


DESCRIPTION

	Bnetd is a program that will eventually emulate a Starcraft Battle.net
	server.  It is distributed under the GPL so that others may contribute
	to the development.  It currently runs on Unix and Unix like systems
	and also Win32.  The code is based on the original bnetd-0.3 by Mark
	Baysinger which was distributed on http://www.starhack.ml.org/ until
	that domain went away.  Mark's work also spawned several versions for
	MS-Windows, most notably FSGS.


STATUS

	The server currently implements most of the same functionality as the
	real Battle.net servers.  You can chat, play games, use /-commands,
	and things like account passwords, user icons, ad banners, channel
	operators, ladder, and Diablo games work too.  It is by no means
	complete, though.  Different clients may be supported to different
	extents.  See the CHANGELOG for summaries about specific modifications.


DOWNLOADING

	The latest version of the program can be found at
	 http://www.bnetd.org/files.php
	 http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~rocombs/sc
	 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6933


INSTALLING

	See the INSTALL file in the distribution directory.  Other information
	including Instructions for installing on Win32 with the Borland
	compiler is avaliable in the docs directory.


RUNNING

	Just run ./bnetd.  It will begin waiting for connections.  Run
	./bnetd --help for help with command-line options.  If no config file
	is specified, it will look for a config file in a location determined
	when the server was compiled.  If that file doesn't exist, it will use
	some built-in default settings.


CONFIGURING THE CLIENT

	Supported client game software titles:
	 Starcraft (and the Brood War expansion pack)
	 Diablo (only version 1.05 and later)
	 Warcraft II Battle.net Edition
	 Diablo II (only open gameplay)

	MS-Windows:

	Download a copy of the program BNS.exe.  This program will allow you to
	choose any bnetd, FSGS, or Battle.net server by manipulating the
	registry.  Instead of starting your game client manually, run BNS and
	choose which client to launch and enter the hostname or IP address of
	the computer which you wish to connect to instead of Battle.net.  Only
	the game clients installed on your system will be selectable.  Clicking
	Apply will set the server and launch the selected game client, but will
	not exit BNS.  Clicking Cancel will abort all changes and exit BNS.
	Clicking OK will exit BNS after applying the changes.

	MacOS:

	There is no automated tool to modify the resources (yet).  To do it
	manually, first locate the Starcraft (or Diablo) preference file
	located in the Preferences folder inside the System folder.  Open the
	file with ResEdit to check if you have the HKEY resources called:
	 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Battle.net\Configuration\Server List"
	 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Battle.net\Configuration\Client ID"
	If you do not have these resources, you will have to download the demo
	of Starcraft from Blizzard and connect to Battle.net.  The demo will
	create the necessary resource entries for you.
	
	Once you have those two entries, use ResEdit to change:
	 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Battle.net\Configuration\Server List"
	to the IP addresses or hostnames of the server you wish to connect to.


SUPPORT

	If you have trouble with the server or setting up the clients, you
	should check to see if the answer to your problem is in our FAQ.  The
	current version can be found on
	http://www.bnetd.org/doc.php?docname=FAQ.html. If that doesn't solve
	your problem, try posting in one of the forums at
	http://www.bnetd.org/phpBB.  You can also send email to the list
	bnetd-discuss@bnetd.org.  See the file README.debugging in the docs
	directory for information about submitting good bug reports.

	Other documents are included in the docs directory of this
	distribution including README.ladder and README.adbanner which
	contain information about setting up and using those features of the
	server.


CONTRIBUTING

	Discovered anything about the Battle.net protocol that we overlooked?
	Have some ideas that you would like to see implemented in the server?
	Please consider either posting in http://www.bnetd.org/phpBB/ or
	sending mail to to the list bnetd-dev@bnetd.org.  Please note that
