## Overview

Sometimes you simply donâ€™t need to use all the features of a CMS. 
Bombolone lets you have a good core, with five modules are essential 
for almost all web applications.

You can control them from the administration panel, and each has 
different tools to edit, create or delete.
It's important to note that beginning the application has two types 
of users: administrators and users. Administrator can do everything. 
Users can only edit content and other little things,
but configurable to allow multiple levels of access depending on rank.

The core modules are as follows:
* Users
* Rank
* Pages
* Languages
* HashTable


## Core Modules
