A simple script to turn a gmail account into a mail sharing mailing list
Please note that newman at https://github.com/mendicant-university/newman is a full framwork that has a simple mailing list example
so this script is no longer needed 



to join the mailing list simply send an email with the title "add me"
to leave the mailing list simply send an email with the title "remove me"
all other emails will be transfered with their attachements to all recipiants in the list.

need to add:
1. better security
2. better configuration
3. removing attachements after sending mail
4. allowing more commands
5. checking for errors
6. using a clever programming techniques
