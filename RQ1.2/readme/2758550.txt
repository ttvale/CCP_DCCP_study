About
=====

This project provides a Flash plug-in for remembering the user's volume selection. It will store their preference in a SharedObject (aka Flash cookie), and use that value when the player is used again.

Setup
=====

To use the plugin, you can either compile a SWF yourself by downloading the source code, or just simply grab the `VolumePreferences.swf` file from the project's bin-release folder. Once you have that, you can [include it as a plugin](http://support.brightcove.com/en/docs/editing-settings-players#analytics) to the player, or [add it as a Module to the BEML](http://support.brightcove.com/en/docs/adding-custom-component-player-template) for your player.
