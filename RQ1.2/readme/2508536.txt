Game Of Life implementation for ThoughtWorks
    --- by Karan Misra

This implementation has been development from ground up using TDD. 
A total of 46 unit tests (as of 4:55 AM, 3rd Jan 2012) confirm the
implemented logic in the submission. The 'Diehard' seed (from Wiki)
has also been proven to work perfectly in the algorithem.

A strongly typed SortedDictionary<..> is used to benefit from its
internal BST implementation. This makes retrieval a O(log n) operation
which 'SHOULD' theoritically help the algorith when dealing with
large sized grids.

The 'cells' are stored in a dictionary (implemented as a BST) only
when they are in the 'live' state. Everything else is 'dead' by default.

LINQ is used extensively to easily calculate the tick move. The source
code has also been document (fairly well) to explain the approach taken.

The implementation is immutable (the next generation is a pure function
of its previous state.)
