# Backbone memory sync adapter v0.1.0

Simplistic memory-only sync adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to memory.

Use for testing or volatile data that need no persistence.

## Usage

Include backbone.memory.js after having included Backbone.js:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.memory.js"></script>

Create your collections like so:

    window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
      storage: new Store("SomeCollection"), // Unique name within your app.
      
      // ... everything else is normal.
      
    });
  
Feel free to use Backbone as you usually would, this is a drop-in replacement.
