Eight-Queens-Problem is a famous puzzle.

---How to solve?

The puzzle has an 8 X 8 matrix. The user has to place eight queens in this matrix in such a manner that no two queens lie in the same row, same column or even the same diagonal.

---About code...

I have implemented this code using JAVA (Frame, Dialog, ActionListener classes primarily) and have also implemented thread functionality(for setting up the time-limit which is 2 minutes(120,000 ms) here).

---How to run the code?

execute the shell script compile.sh(the code files and the script should be in the same folder).

or

compile the files EightQueens.java($ javac EightQueens.java), Dialog1.java($ javac Dialog1.java) and Application.java($ javac Application.java) and run Application.class($ java Application).

What do you need to install?

As the code is written in java, You just need to install JAVA if you donot have it on your system...
