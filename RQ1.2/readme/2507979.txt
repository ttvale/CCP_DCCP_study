This is a Pong-Game for the Arduino microcontroller. The display will be a LoL-Shield from JimmiePRodgers.
As soon I finished the code, I will upload instructions how to build the hardware.

PS: This is my first attempt in C++. So any recommendations about my code are welcome! :)

To-Do
-I noticed some flickering. Maybe double-buffering will help
-Add a single player mode
-I think the max ball speed is a bit too low
