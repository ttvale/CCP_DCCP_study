The li3_perf library provides a toolbar for your Lithium application
useful for debugging. Various performance factors are displayed in this
toolbar including time to load, database query explains, and more.
The Lithium log files (within resources/tmp/logs) are also displayed
in this toolbar.

Note: It is suggested that you have a program called "ccze" installed
on your machine. While not required, it makes the log output colored
and formatted with HTML. Otherwise, it will just be one color.

Also Note: You must have a newer version of Lithium. There was
a change to the lithium/data/collection class. An additional method
was added so that the $this->_result could be returned. This property
contains the MongoCursor, which is required to display the explain()
for Mongo queries.
