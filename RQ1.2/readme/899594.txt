Sleepy
======

Sleepy is a library that simplifies the creation of symanic RESTful
apis.

- tools that encourage using appropriate HTTP request types

- decorators that function as 'guards' to verify that certain
  conditions are met before the underlying method is called. These allow
  your method definitions to be concise.

- various helper functions that have been used for apis around akimbo.
