The purpose of this project is to play with and combine various technologies:
 * A (really) basic framework based on [Restlets](http://www.restlet.org/) to manage dynamically web services
 * Java modularisation achieved through [OSGI](http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage) and declarative services
 * The use of [BND](http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/Bnd) to manage declarative services through anotations 
 * A build orchestrated by Maven
 * A project managed by [PAX construct](http://www.ops4j.org/projects/pax/construct/)

My intention here is to discover (hands on) these technologies, no more ! About combining Restlets and OSGI you should check out [Bryan Hunt's work](http://bryanhunt.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/osgi-at-rest/) and have a look at the [Restlet OSGI edition](http://wiki.restlet.org/developers/172-restlet/267-restlet/124-restlet.html).
