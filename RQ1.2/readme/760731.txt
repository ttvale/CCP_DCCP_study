An Emacs version of
[Chris Kempson's "Tomorrow" themes](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme),
with much more extensive face definitions than the "official" Emacs
variant.

These five color themes are designed for use with Emacs' built-in
theme support in Emacs 24, and provide a variety of contrast levels
with a broadly consistent colour assignment for each.

## Installation ##

If you're all set up to use
[MELPA](http://melpa.org/) (highly recommended!), simply

    M-x package-install RET color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow RET

Otherwise, ensure a directory containing these files is on your `load-path`, then

    (require 'color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow)

## Usage ##

Use the `load-theme` command, to activate one of these themes
programatically, or use `customize-themes` to select a theme
interactively.

Aternatively, use one of the provided wrapper commands to activate a
theme:

    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-day
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-night
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-blue
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-bright
    M-x color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties

In newer Emacs versions, just require the library as above, then

    M-x customize-themes
