Enlightenment 0.17.0 - IN DEVELOPMENT... not a RELEASE.

Requirements:
-------------

Must:
  libc libm libX11 libXext evas ecore ecore-evas ecore-file ecore-ipc ecore-con
  ecore-job ecore-imf ecore-img-evas edje eet embryo efreet efreet-mime
  edbus ecore-txt
  [png loader in evas, jpeg loader in evas, eet loader in evas, software_x11
  engine in evas, buffer engine in evas]

Recommended:
  libpam [xrender engine in evas]

NOTE: Users of DR16 will need to rename the $prefix/bin/enlightenment
file prior to installing DR17 or it will be overwritten.

You can also use the configure --prefix option to put e17 in a separate tree
of its own (recommended) like:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/e17

You will, as usual need to add the subsequent bin dir to your $PATH etc.


NOTES:

* do NOT use -mfpmath=sse in CFLAGS - we are not sure, but it may have bugds
and screws up things in edje, evas and e17. if your gcc uses this by default
(which apparently gcc4.x does on amd64), turn it off with a -fpmath=387 in
your CFLAGS.

* your freetype2 version must be > 2.1.7

* i remember hearing of bugs with later versions of freetype on some
distributions (2.1.9 and 2.1.10) with certain patches or missing certain
patches. be aware of this as a possible font problem.
