Use Github's post-receive hooks to comment on or resolve JIRA issues.

To use:
- copy config/jira-TEMPLATE.yml to config/jira.yml and put your JIRA credentials in this file.
- deploy to a server that accepts incoming POSTs from github
- on your github repository, go to Admin > Service Hooks > Post-Receive URLs, and put your url in.
- commit to your repository

Triggers:

In your comment include "(resolve[sd]?|fixe?[sd]?) PROJECT-241" to resolve PROJECT-241.
For any issue key (i.e. PROJECT-241) in your commit message, the message will be attached to the bug as a comment.
