# Twitter Bootstrap theme for Drupal

This is August Ash's altered version of the Twitter Bootstrap Drupal module. We've basically made some simple changes that are important for the type of work we're doing.

## Install Instructions

1. Download the Ash Bootstrap library v2 (https://github.com/augustash/bootstrap/), make sure the resulting folder is named "bootstrap"
2. Put the bootstrap folder inside the twitter_bootstrap theme folder, [path to themes]/twitter_boostrap/bootstrap/
3. Put any plugin files into [path to themes]/twitter_boostrap/bootstrap/js/

## Pull in Upstream Changes

2. git pull upstream 7.x-2.x
