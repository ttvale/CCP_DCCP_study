Program that solves levels in 'Bubble Blast 2' (and others similar to it) game on Android OS.
Used 6x5 field, so if you need other sizes change it in field.h

Build & Use

make
bb2_solver

On my pc it falls with field filled with '1' and 5 clicks (4GB RAM), 
so use it accurately. But in real levels there are many empty cells
and clicks dont above 4~5 so program will work properly.

If you want program to generate graph.txt for GraphWiz run it with any arguments, for example:
"bb2_solver make this graph!"


ПОТОМУ ЧТО.
