# rubyinstaller-org

## Important

This codebase is an unfinished attempt to build a Sinatra-based application for the RubyInstaller project.
The live website is based on this repository: https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller.org-website

If you want to report issues with current site, please use it's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller.org-website/issues).

## Getting Started

The website requires Ruby 1.9.3 (patchlevel 0 at this time) and [Isolate](https://github.com/jbarnette/isolate)

Simply invoke `rake isolate:env` so it install all the required dependencies for you.

These dependencies will be installed inside `tmp` directory, so it will not pollute your system.

## Running locally

During development you can run the application using the following command

```
ruby -S rake isolate:sh["ruby -S rackup"]
```

I know, very mouthful, but using `ruby -S` avoid hitting the Ctrl+C issue generated by the usage of batch files:

```
>> Stopping ...
Terminate batch job (Y/N)?
```

You never know if you need to say yes or no to that...

Until we have `rake.exe` and `rackup.exe` scripts, this is the only workaround.
