TypingTest
==========

TypingTest will be a native Cocoa typing test application for Mac OS X. It will allow the user to enter some text for a test, and then to take the typing test. It will update the typing statistics (WPM, total mistakes, etc.) live while the test is being undergone, and even once the test is complete. I plan to convert this application to be document based, in order to allow easy storing/loading of tests and test results.
