## Current

I rebuild the site using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). At the moment it looks the same, but I'll probably shred it pretty soon.

I built this site by hand (will a little PostCSS) after being laid off from [Gilt](https://www.gilt.com/boutique/). I thought I might need a hit on the [Google searches](https://www.google.com/search?q=nathan+stilwell) in case I needed another job some day. I whipped it up over a weekend leveraging some stuff I was working on for PhotoOp (probably). I strung together some gulp plugins to build the CSS. The icons I _compiled_ using some gulp task that was lost to time. I talked about it [here](https://github.com/nathanstilwell/svg-sprite-talk).
