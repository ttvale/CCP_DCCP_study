Summary
=======

This project proposed a unified modeling framework for the traveller's choice of activity type, 
timing and duration. In the decision-making process, the traveler exhibits _forward-looking behavior_, 
i.e. the traveler realize the impact of the current choice on the future utility and 
take into account the future utility that he can obtain. Therefore, the activity scheduling behavior 
is formulated as a _Markov Decision Process_. _Dynamic programming technique_ is adopted to solve
solve the problem and maximum likelihood method is employed to estimate the model parameters.
