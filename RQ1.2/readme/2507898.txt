My personal website, rewritten for the gazllionth time. This time it's powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);
Feel free to dig around in the code to see how this all works.

Note that this was written just days after svelte-kit came out, which is a while ago. Best-practices used here might already be out of date, but the general structure should still work for a vanilla svelte-kit app. If you see anything that can be done nicer these days, let me know!
