This repository contains the W3 specification for Browser Automation.
The main repository is at <http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/> and there

Generating the specification

The webdriver-spec.html is generated by executing:

    make

The numbers at the start of each file corresponds to sections in the
spec.


Validating the specification

To validate the specification you need to first set up a number of
dependencies on your system:

  * Selenium Python package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium>
    Available from PyPI as selenium.

  * linkchecker <https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/link-checker/>
    On Debian/Ubuntu this is available as the w3c-linkchecker package.

  * An implemenation of Java 1.6 or newer

  * curl <http://curl.haxx.se/>
    On Debian/Ubuntu this is available as the curl package.

All of these programs must be available on your PATH for validation to
succeed.

To validate the specification set the BROWSER environmental variable
to your favourite WebDriver supported browser and call the `validate'
target as such:

    BROWSER=firefox make validate

Available browsers are firefox, chrome, ie, and opera.
