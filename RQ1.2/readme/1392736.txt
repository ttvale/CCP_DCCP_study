Introduction
============

This is the [EyeWriter 1.0](http://eyewriter.org) project.

For use with the version outlined [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-EyeWriter/):



Build
=====

On Windows:
-----------

To build the project you need to first download and install the correct 
openFrameworks package and the corresponding Code::Blocks version. Then you need 
to position the root eyewriter folder (the one which contains the subfolders 
bin, obj, src, etc.) in a subfolder of the 'apps' folder of the openFrameworks 
package. So for example the 'eyewriter.workspace' file will be in the 
"of_v0.7.4_win_cb_release\apps\eyewriter\eyewriter-1.0\" folder.
Once you've done that, you should be able to open the 'eyewriter.workspace' file 
using Code::Blocks and hit the "Build and run" button.


Usage
=====

The videos [here](http://eyewriter.org/developer/) explain how to use the 
software.

Note that mouse support is currently disabled (commented out) and that the 
"mouse simulation" button in "calibration" mode is dead (not yet implemented).

Also note that some settings (most notably whether the software will read its 
input from a video file or from a camera) can only be changed manually in the 
"eyewriter-1.0\bin\data\settings\globalSettings.xml" file.


Prerequisites
=============

 *  Different versions of eyewriter may need different versions of 
	openFrameworks in order to compile and run. In turn, openFrameworks may 
	require different versions of specific IDEs. A list of combinations that are 
	known to work should be documented in the 'Compatibility' section below, 
	while the openFrameworks requirements should be documented in the 
	[openFrameworks page](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/).
 *  Apple's QuickTime Player must be installed?!

Compatibility
=============

 *  This version is known to work on Windows with openFrameworks 0.7.4 and 
	Code::Blocks 12.11.
 *  Mac OS X?
