A grails (grails.org) based demo agent for the PowerTAC competiton.

#### Communication with server
Agent makes web service (WS) call to authenticate with the server using username and password.  The WS call will response
with URL to JMS server and agent's JMS destination name (queue name).  After login, communication between server and agent
is over JMS messages.

Communication is abstracted via JmsManagementService. JmsManagementService provides message listener registration mechanism
for receving messages, sending mechanism for sending messages.

See sample implementation @ /grails-app/services/org/powertac/broker/CompetitionManagementService.groovy


### Structure
Each component of an agent is wired up using Spring allow easy replacement of different implementation in resource file.

See @ /grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
