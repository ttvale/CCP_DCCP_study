The restPHP Classes
===============================

These are a couple of simple helper classes to help in writing RESTful PHP Libraries.
They are intended to be extended by other libraries wishing to get a solid start
to their external API's, where you simply need to provide your data model by
deriving each resource object from restPHP_Resource.
