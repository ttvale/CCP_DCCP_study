BioMixer is a Web-based environment for visualizing and exploring biomedical ontologies. It is the underlying technology for the visualization components found in BioPortal(http://bioportal.bioontology.org/), the worldâ€™s most comprehensive repository of biomedical ontologies.

BioMixer's development is supported by the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), the NHGRI, the NHLBI, the NIH Common Fund under Grant #U54-HG004028, and an IBM CAS PhD Fellowship.

For in vivo visualizations, see the visualization tab on individual concept pages at BioPortal (e.g. http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/SNOMEDCT?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.bioontology.org%2Fontology%2FSNOMEDCT%2F82968002).
