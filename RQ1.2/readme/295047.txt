This is the exact Google's Swiffy Runtime and fixes the compatibility issue with Jquery and Zepto.

I had to change this for a project i'm working on with Zepto. The project was already started and couldn't rewrite all the $ instances that cause the errors.
Basically what i did is to replace all the $[index] with $__[index].
