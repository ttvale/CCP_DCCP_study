I forgot to mention here that the system is predicated on having the index.php removed via mod_rewrite (or whatever means)
and will not work well (or in some cases at all) if it is not set up that way.

The .htaccess that I use to eliminate index.php is this:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.*
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^application.*
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]
</IfModule>

This .htaccess may not work for you, so you may have to find another variant.  Also be sure to remove the index.php
from the config.php file so that codeigniter doesn't expect it.

Fixed the <select> tag generation to not include a browser generated spurious </select> tag.
Added a template that is intended for use with the Twitter Bootstrap css/javascript package.

Added functionality to import a mysql table.

Just fill in the database fields at the bottom of the form and click "import table"
Fill in the form name and action and then process the form and it should automagically generate the files needed based
on the table format.

I -strongly- urge that you host this yourself on your own server if you use this functionality.  While my demo site does
not save the database information, you cannot trust that a system is not compromised or a person is trustworthy (even
myself), so having this under your own control on a (preferably private) server is a much saner route.

Basically just swap in the files in this archive to the appropriate locations under your codeigniter installation, and access it via the your_domain.com/tools/form_builder url

You can see a running copy of this at http://www.bottledsanity.com/tools/form_builder

Codeigniter can be found here: http://codeigniter.com/

If you have any questions, or for some reason this doesnt work out of the box, feel free to holler at me at ariven@gmail.com


My method of programming has a master template that is used to wrap around most pages.  This makes it easier for me to design a site.
I have included a primative template in the views folder named template.php.  Removing the template portions should not be hard.

Under the views folder is a folder named form_builder.  This folder contains the views needed for the form generation process.
in views/form_builder/templates there are sub folders, in each sub folder you can put a variant of the four files used for generating form items.

files:
application/controllers/tools.php - the controller that handles the form builder
application/views/form_builder/
	form_builder.php - the master generation form
	form_builder_single_item.php - used to render the sample items for the form to give you an idea of whats on your form

application/views/form_builder/templates/*
	submit_button.php - the submit button that is placed on the html form
	form_builder_item.php - the html code that is rendered
	form_builder_javascript.php - the javascript code that is rendered
	form_builder_php.php - the php code that is rendered
	template_name.txt - the name of this variant of the template, used on the template picker on the main generate tab

assets/css/jquery-ui.css - the jquery-ui css file used for the jquery-ui code
assets/css/images - images used for jquery-ui.css

js/array_functions.js - a couple array functions needed for the process including one from http://phpjs.org/functions/serialize
js/form_builder.js - functions for running the form builder
js/form_builder_functions.js - functions for running the form builder (could be combined with form_builder.js
js/plugins.js - the cookie function from https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie  -- needed for CSRF fix
