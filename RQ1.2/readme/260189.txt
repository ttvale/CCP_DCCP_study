local_seriesly
=====
This is a reimplementation of seriesly without Google's App Engine or Django. It lets you fetch the data of new episodes of your favourite tv show from tvrage.com and displays it as an html document. All those nifty little parts of the original seriesly like XMPP or RSS integration aren't implemented, since i don't need them.

local_seriesly is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)

This project uses the CSS and HTML stuff of the original Seriesly (https://github.com/stefanw/seriesly) that is also licensed under the AGPL3.0.

==========
Installation
=====
To install local_seriesly just copy all files into a directory of your choice. The directory "./data" should be accessible through a web-server (e.g. Apache).

You can also use the local_seriesly_server. It uses CherryPy and lets you generate and access the html files. The data still needs to be fetched regulary. For this you can use a cronjob. The port, ip and path of the server can be changed in the source file.

To configure your profiles edit the file "./show_id.cfg".

To find the right ids go to "http://services.tvrage.com/feeds/search.php?show=SHOW_NAME" (replace SHOW_NAME with the actual name of the show) and copy the listed id to the config file.

==========
Usage
=====
local_seriesly.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -f, --fetch     fetch data
  -g, --generate  generate the html documents
  -r, --remove    remove html files and fetched data
  -l, --list      list all shows by name that are currently in a profile
  -p, --profiles  list all profiles and their shows

You can just execute the script by hand whenever you need it, or configure some cron jobs.

If the local_seriesly_server is running, you can access your profile using following URL: 'http://127.0.0.1:8070/show?PROFILENAME'. To fetch data, simply replace 'show' with 'fetch' in the URL.

==========
Requirements
=====
To use local_seriesly you just need Python. A web server is more or less optional but useful if multiple users want to access local_seriesly.

To use the local_serielsy_server you also need CherryPy.

local_seriesly is developed and tested under Python 2.7.2. But its possible to convert the scripts to Python 3 using 2to3.
