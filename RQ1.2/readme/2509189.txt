README for deployer

Installation
------------

The deployer scripts are currently intended to be installed in a user account.

It is recomended that you set up a special user on the deploy server to handle
git repositories and deployment.


Init repository
---------------

Run the init script to crete a new repository. The script will create a new bare
git repository and add a post receive hook to deploy the code.

    $ bin/deployer-init myapp

In the example above a new repository 'myapp.git' will be created.


Deploying
---------

When changes are pushed to a properly initialized git repository the content of 
the repository will be deployed as a new release.

    $ bin/deployer-checkout

The post-receive hook deploy-checkout will be called. It will check out the 
content into a directory structure, like the one below, where [deploy_to] is 
where in the file system we want to deploy to and [app_name] is the name of 
the application we are deploying (same as the repository name minus the .git
suffix).

    [deploy_to]
    [deploy_to]/[app_name]
    [deploy_to]/[app_name]/releases
    [deploy_to]/[app_name]/releases/20111227213207
    [deploy_to]/[app_name]/current -> [deploy_to]/releases/20111227213207

Each time we deploy a new directory will be created under the releases directory
and the new version will be placed there. Then the current symlink will be 
updated to point to that directory.
