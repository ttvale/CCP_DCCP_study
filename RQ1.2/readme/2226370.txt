# tumblr2html

tumblr2html is an open source app that creates a static HTML copy of a tumblr blog, including uploaded media (like photos).

## Installation

Just download the sources, and run tumblr2html.py.
You will need to have django installed (pip install django) and a tumblr API key, get one from http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps

## Status

It works, but it should be considered still alpha.

## TODO
-   handle answer, video and audio posts.
-   Download pages (I can't find how to do this through the API)
-   Pagination and archives
-   Improve the appearance of generated HTML
-   Incremental "backups"
