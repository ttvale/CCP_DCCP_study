Circuitscape is a free, open-source program which borrows algorithms
from electronic circuit theory to predict patterns of movement, gene
flow, and genetic differentiation among plant and animal populations
in heterogeneous landscapes. Circuit theory complements least-cost
path approaches because it considers effects of all possible pathways
across a landscape simultaneously. We are developing Circuitscape for
Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.
