To use this, include the following line somewhere on your page:

<?php include "mine_pubmed.php"; ?>

There are two functions that this makes available:

1) function get_PMIDs ($query, $return_count=false)
For a given query, this function will return the total number of publications and an array of the PMIDs of the matching publications. You can get both of these returned like this:
	list($PMID, $count) = get_PMIDs($query);

You can retrieve just the second count by passing True to the second optional parameter:
	$count = get_PMIDs($query, true);


2) function get_summary ($this_PMID)
This function takes a single PMID and returns various parameters of the publication. You can get all of the returned parameters like this:

	list($authors, $title, $abstract, $date_pubmed, $date_rec, $date_acc, $journal, $affil) = get_summary( $this_PMID );
