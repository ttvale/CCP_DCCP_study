Screenshot Webservice
=====================

Screenshot Webservice is an open-source **REST web service** to perform **web page screenshots**.

**PhantomJS** is used for rendering pages.

**Play2 framework** is used for everything else:

* Caching
* Configuration (autorized formats and sizes, ...)
* Handling a multi-processing screenshot requests queue
* REST
  * GET and HEAD supported
  * HTTP Status Code for easily identifying failures
  * HTTP Headers

Installation
============

--------------------

* **Play20** *HEAD* to start the application (or only java if you deploy it)
  * See https://github.com/playframework/Play20
* `phantomjs` 1.4.0(+) installed in the system
  * See http://www.phantomjs.org/

Download it
-----------

The API
=======

Screenshot an URL
-----------------

`GET /screenshot.{format}`

### Input

* `format` *Required (url)* : **string** (example: jpg, png, ...) as defined in the conf
* `url` *Required* : **string**
* `size` *Optional* : ***{width}*x*{height}*** (example: 1024x1024) as defined in the conf

### Response

#### 200 Success

* Content-Type: image/jpg
* Expires: 23 Dec 2011 12:00:48 GMT
* Last-Modified: 23 Dec 2011 11:30:48 GMT
* Etag: 0d21b5bdca5db7fe8ae17b88f6dabb66167f2721
* Content-Length: 478349

*[image binary in the body]*

#### 403 Forbidden

something is wrong in your parameters and not supported by the server

#### 503 Service Unavailable

The server was not able to finish processing the screenshot

To avoid this problem, prefer using a HEAD request before and ensure the resource is ready.

#### 500 Internal Server Error

something goes wrong during the screenshot processing

### Example

`GET /screenshot.jpg?url=http://github.com&size=1024x1024`

Precache an URL
-----------------
You can use a **HEAD** request to trigger the screenshot processing.
The API and responses are the same as the GET API.
Instead of waiting the screenshot resource to be ready, the web service returns a 202 http code if the resource is still processing.

### Additional responses

#### 202 Accepted

The URL is being process but not yet ready

#### 200 OK

* Content-Type: image/png
* Expires: 26 Dec 2011 11:28:18 GMT
* Last-Modified: 26 Dec 2011 10:58:18 GMT
* Etag: f5b12d7e242ff0ad36e18bd842bb74b161d4cf58
* Content-Length: 478349

The URL is ready to get
