================================================================================

The Orchestrate project represents the modular foundation which will provide
support for OSGi in Liferay portal. As such it will contain the code for the
base bundles providing management of OSGi framework (and bundles), and
specifically implementations of an OSGi Web Container and these specifications:

- Http Service Specification
- Web Applications Specification

Other required OSGi specifications will be supplied by existing
implementations provided by other open source projects where applicable.

In the future the Orchestrate project may implement other OSGi specifications as
the need arises.
