# DEPRECATED

With v2 of i18next it's no longer needed to separate the node.js version from the main i18next main repo.

i18next-node can be replaced with:

- [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next) for standalone use and otherwise
- [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next) and [i18next-express-middleware](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-express-middleware) for express apps

see [Migration Guide](http://i18next.com/docs/migration/)
