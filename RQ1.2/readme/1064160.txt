This system of file editing seems actually very useful.

It will likely make collaboration very easy and will allow us to branch quickly and easily in and out of different mods.

At this point, it seems we don't have much space to work with, so it seems practical not to make graphical overhauls, so much as just write straight code.

Edit this as you please, I'm working on figuring out how to create projects.

Let's start by figuring out how we're going to structure this thing; what file types are we using?
