This is a template for Latex-based presentations.

It was taken from http://www.shawnlankton.com/2008/02/beamer-and-latex-with-keynote-theme/

This Latex template needs the following Debian packages:

texlive texlive-latex-recommended prosper chaksem texlive-science 
texlive-generic-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended ttf-marvosym  
texlive-extra-utils texlive-extra texlive-fonts-extra

I suggest using Eclipse and Texlipse.
