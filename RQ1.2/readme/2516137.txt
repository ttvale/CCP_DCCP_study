DRA APPLICATION README

Welcome to the Department of Recording Arts perl application readme.  If you're
reading this you may be trying to install this application for the first time.
If so, read on...

REQUIREMENTS

This application was written using Perl for the XServe platform and is
compatible with Leopard and Snow Leopard operating systems.

INSTALLATION

Unpack this folder and its contents anywhere on the system. Suitable locations
include:

/usr/local/dra
/Users/audiouser/Applications/dra

The application is completely self-contained.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

The dra application requires a couple of environment variables.  Please ensure
that these are set for whichever user will be running the commands. This can be
done several ways, but the easiest is probably by adding the following to your
.bashrc file:

# DRA_HOME=[full path to this folder]
# export DRA_HOME
#
# PATH=$PATH:$DRA_HOME/bin
# export PATH
#
# MANPATH=$MANPATH:$DRA_HOME/man
# export MANPATH

The rest of the documentation can be found under the doc folder or by typing:

# man [any script in the bin directory] 

from the command line.

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

The dra application requires afconvert, which comes standard with OSX, and
normalize which is available via GPL.

ERROR REPORTING

All of the dra scripts use a verbose amount of logging, both for the script
log and the logs that are written within a particular project folder. If any
script exits without any fatal errors or problems otherwise, there will be no
output. If there is any problem, either with the script itself such as a bad
parameter, or a problem with any of the operations to the project folders,
there should be a copious amount of verbage outputted to STDOUT along with an
exit code of something other than 0.

If you run one of the commands and are expecting some output, check the logs.
