Hi. I'm Jonathan Rascher, and this is my resume. I've always written it in
LaTeX, and it seemed like a good exercise to start versioning it under Git so
I could easily back it up and share it online.

You probably don't want to build it yourself (just [download it][1]!), but if
you really want to try, grab a copy of [Latexmk][2] and run `latexmk -pdf` from
this directory.

Also, if such things interest you, the fonts used are members of the excellent
[Minion Pro][3] and [Fertigo Pro][4] families. Minion Pro is distributed with
Adobe Reader and Adobe Creative Suite, Fertigo Pro Regular is freely available
online, and Fertigo Pro Italic must be purchased from one of various online
font stores linked to from the author's site.
