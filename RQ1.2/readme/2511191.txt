To install this update, use Windows Update or visit the link belowe:

This project however can be used for study of the IIS Modules and for future
problems.
  
  
# Old README

## The Problem

This is a simple IIS 7 module to avoid the zero day vulnerability which targets
string hash colisions discovered by Alexander "alech" Klink and Julian "zeri"
WÃ¤lde [1] which is described in a security advisory [2].

There was a security advisory [2] of Microsoft describing the problem and a
blog post explaing in details the problem [3].

## The Proposed Solution

This solution consists in expection the request input before ASP .net and
detecting duplicated form post hashes.

If the form post is "big" ann contains a duplicated hash then the request
is rejected.

I used some reference to implement this module. [5]

## Warning

This solution needs more work, I only released it now to share the discovery
with the community and to receive comments.

I will add more checks and check more data at input, it will be released
until the end of the week.

Please send any comments to <sergio@ginx.com.br>.
