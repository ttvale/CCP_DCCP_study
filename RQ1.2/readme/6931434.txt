Breaking Points

Breaking Points (2010) is a time-based video collage of sound and images recorded on the northern coast of France where bunkers built during the second world war dominate the landscape.

The grand melancholic photographs of the weather-beaten bunkers have been coded in such a way so that they are randomly selected from a bank of hundreds and so that new combinations of images are continuously generated.

The result is a work, which, just like the topography surrounding the bunkers, endlessly destructs and constructs itself. 

Breaking Points was produced by Le Fresnoy (FR) and is a collaboration between Thomas Lock, Hellicar & Lewis and Robin Rimbaud (Scanner).

Use watershedApp to generate new Watershed files. (Limited to 5 images)

Use breakingPointsApp to see the original installation. (Use imagery from Watershed App, no Audio)
This has bugs to do with image loading over a long period.

Use breakingPointsIIApp to see the second installation. (Use imagery from Watershed App, no Audio)
This corrects the bugs in the original version.
