## Information

Provides a way to have workers on your webapp servers, especially useful for webapps that tend to scale up and down with X amount of servers in the load balancer.  Also good way to not use another dependent resource like a job scheduler/queue.  Keeps your application all packaged up nicely, no cron jobs to set, nothing else to think about setting up and nothing else to maintain.

## Installation

`gem install webapp_worker`

or use it in your Gemfile

`gem 'webapp_worker'`

## Quick Test

	waw -e development -f jobs.yml (parses data)
	waw -e development -f jobs.yml  -j (parses and shows jobs)
	waw -e development -f jobs.yml  -n 4 (parses and shows the next N run times, by job)
	waw -e development -f jobs.yml -r (parses and starts to run)
	waw -e development -f jobs.yml -d (parses and turns on debugging)
	waw -e development -f jobs.yml -v (parses and turns on verbose logging)

## Using in your webapp

Create a jobs yaml file.

	---
	local:
		mailto: user@nobody.com
		actual_hostname:
			- :command: "rake test"
				:minute: 0
			- :command: "rake test"
				:minute: 45

Load this file somewhere in your web app, like an initializer file.

	jobs = "config/jobs.yml"

	a = WebappWorker::Application.new(environment:"development",mailto:"")
	a.parse_yaml(jobs)
	a.run

You don't have to use a jobs file, you can specify the yaml or hash in the code above like this:

	job = {:command=>"rake job:run", :minute=>"0-59/5", :hour=>"0-4/2", :day=>1, :month=>"0-12/1"}

	a = WebappWorker::Application.new(environment:"development",mailto:"",jobs:[job])
	a.run

You can go further with the above code and run additional "on demand jobs"

	a.run_job("rake job:refresh_cache")

## Example Output of waw

See if Webapp Worker can parse the jobs file and show you all the jobs it can run from the file

	$ waw -e local -f config/jobs.yml -j
	Job File: config/jobs.yml

	Host: localhost
	Mailto:
	Environment: development
	Amount of Jobs: 3

	Job: `rake job:run`
	Job: `rake job:run`
	Job: `rake job:run`

See when the jobs are supposed to run next, next two times, next three times, etc...

	$ waw -e local -f config/jobs.yml -n 4
	Job: `rake job:run`
	   Next Run Time(s): [2012-01-03 22:00:00 -0700, 2012-01-03 22:05:00 -0700, 2012-01-03 22:10:00 -0700, 2012-01-03 22:15:00 -0700]
	Job: `rake job:run`
	   Next Run Time(s): [2012-01-03 22:00:00 -0700, 2012-01-03 22:05:00 -0700, 2012-01-03 22:10:00 -0700, 2012-01-03 22:15:00 -0700]

Run the actual jobs from the command line

	$ waw -e local -f config/jobs.yml -r (optional -d and -v for debug and verbose)
	Running Jobs

## Other Options

You may want to know what version of the gem Webapp Worker is using, so just send a USR1 signal to it

	$ kill -s USR1 11682
	Webapp Worker Version: 0.0.4

You may need to turn on debugging for the Webapp Worker while its running, so just send a USR2 signal to it

	$ kill -s USR2 11682
	Changed logger level to Debug

## Roadmap

- Start creating tests
- Use the mailto attribute in application to actually do something
- Start having the webapp worker registering to a central point or do UDP mutlicasting to find each other.
- Once self registering is enabled, webapp_workers need to communicate effectively.
- Once communication is established webapp_workers need to do the scheduling for themselves.
- Do logging for each type of job in a jobs directory under tmp/webapp_worker, allowing for troubleshooting.
- Spit out reports of the different jobs and how fast they run.
