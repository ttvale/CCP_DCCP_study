One thing many people seem to agree the FreedomBox should do is web
filtering for privacy and ad-removal.  Toward that end, this is a first
draft version of a privoxy package for FreedomBox.

To use, you can do the usual

     cd freedombox-privoxy
     make
     sudo make install

Or if you are on a Debian system:

     cd freedombox-privoxy
     sudo apt-get build-dep privoxy
     sudo apt-get install logrotate docbook-website dpatch
     make deb
     sudo apt-get purge privoxy # yes, this is necessary the first time
     sudo dpkg -i Debian/*.deb
     sudo service freedombox-privoxy restart

If you want to see what I changed, look in
Debian/freedombox-privacy*/debian/patches/9*.dpatch after doing the make
deb.  I'll get some binary packages up for x86 and Dream Plug soon.

This package differs from the standard Debian privoxy package in a few
key ways.

 * First (and most importantly) it doesn't just listen on localhost.  The
plan is eventually to control access to it via iptables, so by default
it listens to the world.  Be careful with that if your FreedomBox is
reachable via public net.

 * Second, I imported the https-everywhere ruleset as a privoxy action file
and modified the privoxy binary to handle it.

 * Third, I imported the easyprivacy ruleset from Ad-Block Plus as a
privoxy action file.  Easyprivacy is not included in ABP and most users
are unaware that they can add it in.  To me, that makes it a good
candidate for inclusion here.

 * Fourth, I *started* to pull in the easylist ruleset from ABP.  It is
impossible to fully duplicate easylist with a proxy because the proxy
lacks information the browser uses to make more nuanced decisions about
what to block.  Scripted import of easylist might be buggy, and this
needs more investigation.

 * Fifth, I lowered the amount of filtering compared to the stock
privoxy config (see the match-all.action file for details).  I did this
because unlike a proxy running on your local machine, a proxy that
clients don't control should be a bit more careful about breaking sites.
I'm trying to get down to a level where we don't break anything and then
seeing how we build up from there.

If you are a privoxy user, please do give this package a test run and
report any problems to:

     https://github.com/jvasile/freedombox-privoxy/issues

Further work will include writing a script to test all the
https-everywhere rules and discard the ones that are broken.  
As well as one to periodically check for new regexes.  Anybody
who wants to contribute to writing that is welcome to jump on in!
