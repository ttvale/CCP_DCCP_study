          ActiveHabits

Thanks for taking a look. The vision for ActiveHabits is
to help people help themselves through reflection on their
own actions. A mobile phone app allows personal information
to be recorded in real time.

This is implemented through ActiveHabits by pressing a
button to record the action name, date, time and location.
Charts can be drawn to see one's actions. Associating
playlists to buttons is optional.

Functionally ActiveHabits is an Android application that
saves button clicks, then charts the clicks to provide
visual feedback. The same engine can be repurposed for
many different purposes, not all of which can be
anticipated. The application is flexible enough to track
any activity you care about. I look forward to hearing
how people use ActiveHabits.

The website is http://www.activehabits.com

Original this idea evolved from tracking of my personal
sleep habits, launching playlists via scripts on my
Linux machine as I awake and went to sleep.

While this implementation could be used in many ways but
I will first be supporting making this code even better
for the original intended use.

I welcome other people exploring other uses.  If you are
interested in seeing features implemented and can provide
some resources please contact me.
