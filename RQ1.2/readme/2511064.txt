OVERVIEW

This is a simple C frontend for ARPACK. This allows easy access to
calculating a subset of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of sparse matrices.
Specifically it can solve two problems:
 - Av = vd
 - Av = Mvd
Where A, M are sparse matrices, v is the subset of
eigenvectors and d is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.


DEPENDENCIES

1) libsuitesparse (libsuitesparse-dev)
2) libarpack (libarpack2-dev)

On Ubuntu install the following with:

# apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev libarpack2-dev


INSTALLING

To install run:

# make install

You will have to be root to install it unless you change the path in the Makefile.


DOCUMENTATION

To generate full documentation use the command:

$ make docs

Which will generate a pdf containing the full documentation in the directory.
