NAME
    XML::LibXML::QuerySelector - add querySelector and querySelectorAll
    methods to XML::LibXML nodes

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::LibXML::QuerySelector;
  
      my $document = XML::LibXML->load_xml(location => 'my.xhtml');
      my $warning  = $document->querySelector('p.warning strong');
      print $warning->toString if defined $warning;

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines a class (it has no constructor so perhaps closer to an
    abstract class or a role) XML::LibXML::QuerySelector, and sets itself up
    as a superclass (not a subclass) of XML::LibXML::Document,
    XML::LibXML::DocumentFragment and XML::LibXML::Element, thus making its
    methods available to objects of those classes.

    Yes, this is effectively monkey-patching, but it's performed in a
    *relatively* safe manner.

  Methods
    The methods provided by this module are defined in the W3C Recomendation
    "Selectors API Level 1" <http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/>.

    `querySelector($selector)`
        Given a CSS selector, returns the first match or undef if there are no
        matches.

    `querySelectorAll($selector)`
        Given a CSS selector, returns all matches as a list, or if called in
        scalar context, as an XML::LibXML::NodeList.

CAVEATS
    *   When called on an element, `querySelectorAll` returns a static node
        list; not a live node list. (Called on a document or document
        fragment, it will return a live node list as specified in the W3C
        Recommendation.)

    *   Use on mixed-namespace documents is largely untested. The module is
        mostly intended for use with XHTML and HTML documents.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=XML-LibXML-QuerySelector>.

TODO
    *   Consider adding HTML5 DOM traversal methods including
        `getElementsByClassName`.
