An R package to help manage R projects (e.g. Sweave reports) where multiple versions are created based upon a single source repository. For example, a monthly report where each versions is identitcal with the exception of easily definable parameters (e.g. date ranges for data extraction, title, etc.). This package is not meant to assist with package development or more complex data analysis projects. For those types of projects, consider devtools or ProjectTemplate, respectively.
