In this challenge you will work on a simulation problem with a hydrographic theme. You will be asked to progressively fill an underground cave with water. The cave sports a particular topography of rock formations that will affect the way in which the water flows into it and fills it up. After a certain amount of water has flowed in, you will need to determine the water depth at various points.
