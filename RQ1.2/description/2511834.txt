Sync JS automatically updates HTML, Scripts, data, and other resources within dynamic web pages. Unlike other JS frameworks, Sync JS attempts to significantly reduce the amount of JavaScript needed to create dynamic web applications.   The framework uses a markup-driven approach to drive the behaviors of an application. For instance, when I link is clicked, the framework automatically makes a request to the server and updates the returned HTML or JSON depending on associated metadata.
