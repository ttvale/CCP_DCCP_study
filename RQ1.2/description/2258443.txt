miltons-machine is an open source library of Ruby code primarily dedicated to the analysis and "practical" application of set theory for musical composition - as defined in the various contexts of 12 tone theory and its offshoots (e.g. Forte, Morris, Starr, Lewin, Cohn, etc.).  Additional features and functions from other theoretics will be provided from time to time to supplement this basis.
