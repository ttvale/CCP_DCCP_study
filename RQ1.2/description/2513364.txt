Final project for CS 230 Data Structures.  Keeps track of all the books and patrons in a citywide library system.  As of the last Dec 15th commit, I met all my goals for the class project; I've spent too much time on it to give it up that though.  Look for: The ability to check out books to a specific patron, a database instead of text files to contain the books and patrons, and layout fixes. And, yeah, there's a webapp now too. Webapps are cool.
